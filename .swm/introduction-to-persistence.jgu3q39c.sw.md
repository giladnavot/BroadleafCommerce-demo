title: Introduction to Persistence
---
Persistence in BroadleafCommerce-demo refers to the mechanism that allows data to continue to exist even after the application that created the data has ended. It's a crucial aspect of the application, especially in the context of e-commerce where data such as product information, user details, and transaction records need to be stored and retrieved over time.
