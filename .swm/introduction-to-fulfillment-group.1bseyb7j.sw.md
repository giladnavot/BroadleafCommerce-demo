title: Introduction to Fulfillment Group
---
A Fulfillment Group in Broadleaf Commerce represents a group of items from an order that are shipped together to the same location. It is a key component in the order fulfillment process. The `FulfillmentGroupDao` interface provides methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting Fulfillment Groups. It also provides methods for reading Fulfillment Groups by their status or by their association with an order. The `FulfillmentGroupItemDao` interface, on the other hand, provides similar operations for the items within a Fulfillment Group.

## FulfillmentGroupDao Interface

The `FulfillmentGroupDao` interface provides the methods for interacting with Fulfillment Groups. It includes methods for creating a new Fulfillment Group (`create`), reading a Fulfillment Group by its ID (`readFulfillmentGroupById`), saving a Fulfillment Group (`save`), and deleting a Fulfillment Group (`delete`). It also provides methods for reading Fulfillment Groups based on their fulfillment status (`readUnfulfilledFulfillmentGroups`, `readPartiallyFulfilledFulfillmentGroups`, `readUnprocessedFulfillmentGroups`, `readFulfillmentGroupsByStatus`).

```java
public interface FulfillmentGroupDao {

    public FulfillmentGroup readFulfillmentGroupById(Long fulfillmentGroupId);

    public FulfillmentGroup save(FulfillmentGroup fulfillmentGroup);

    public FulfillmentGroup readDefaultFulfillmentGroupForOrder(Order order);

    public void delete(FulfillmentGroup fulfillmentGroup);

    public FulfillmentGroup createDefault();

    public FulfillmentGroup create();

    public FulfillmentGroupFee createFulfillmentGroupFee();
    
    /**
     * Reads FulfillmentGroups whose status is not FULFILLED or DELIVERED.
     * @param start
     * @param maxResults
     * @return
```

## Using FulfillmentGroupDao in Services

The `FulfillmentGroupDao` is injected into services like `LegacyOrderServiceImpl` to be used for handling Fulfillment Groups within the service methods.

```java
    @Resource(name = "blFulfillmentGroupDao")
    protected FulfillmentGroupDao fulfillmentGroupDao;
```

## FulfillmentGroupDao Implementation

`FulfillmentGroupDaoImpl` is the implementation of the `FulfillmentGroupDao` interface, providing the actual logic for the interface methods.

```java
@Repository("blFulfillmentGroupDao")
public class FulfillmentGroupDaoImpl implements FulfillmentGroupDao {
```
