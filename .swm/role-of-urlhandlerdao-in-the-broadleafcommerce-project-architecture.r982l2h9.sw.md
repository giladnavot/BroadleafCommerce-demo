title: Role of URLHandlerDao in the BroadleafCommerce Project Architecture
---
This document will cover the role and functionality of the URLHandlerDao within the larger project architecture. We'll cover:

1. What is URLHandlerDao?
2. How is URLHandlerDao implemented?
3. How does URLHandlerDao fit within the larger project architecture?

# What is URLHandlerDao?

URLHandlerDao is a Data Access Object (DAO) in the Broadleaf Commerce framework. DAOs are a common pattern in Java applications to abstract and encapsulate all access to the data source. In this case, URLHandlerDao is responsible for handling URL-related data operations.

# How is URLHandlerDao implemented?

URLHandlerDao is an interface that defines the contract for URL-related data operations. It declares methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting URL handlers.

# How does URLHandlerDao fit within the larger project architecture?

In the larger project architecture, URLHandlerDao plays a crucial role in managing URL-related data. It interacts with the database to perform CRUD operations on URL handlers. Other components of the system, such as services and controllers, use URLHandlerDao to interact with URL-related data, thus keeping the data access logic encapsulated and separate from the business logic.
