# Interaction with other components

`SearchCriteria` interacts with `SearchService` and `SearchFacetDTOService` to provide search functionality.

import org.broadleafcommerce.core.web.service.SearchFacetDTOService;
import org.broadleafcommerce.core.web.util.ProcessorUtils;

# Use of SearchCriteria in different classes

`SearchCriteria` is used in `SearchService` to define the criteria for search operations.

```java
import org.broadleafcommerce.core.search.domain.SearchCriteria;
import org.broadleafcommerce.core.search.domain.SearchFacetDTO;
import org.broadleafcommerce.core.search.domain.SearchResult;
```

`SearchCriteria` is also used in `BroadleafCategoryController` to handle category-based search operations.

```java
import org.broadleafcommerce.core.search.domain.SearchCriteria;
import org.broadleafcommerce.core.search.domain.SearchResult;
import org.broadleafcommerce.core.search.service.SearchService;
```
