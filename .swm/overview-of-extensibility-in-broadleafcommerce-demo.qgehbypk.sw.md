title: Overview of Extensibility in BroadleafCommerce-demo
---
Extensibility in BroadleafCommerce-demo refers to the ability of the application to be extended or customized. This is achieved through the use of packages such as 'org.broadleafcommerce.common.extensibility' and 'org.broadleafcommerce.common.extensibility.context.merge'. These packages provide the necessary tools and interfaces to allow developers to add or modify functionalities without altering the core codebase. This is particularly important in an e-commerce framework like Broadleaf, where different businesses may have unique requirements that are not covered by the default functionalities.
