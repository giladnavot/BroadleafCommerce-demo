title: Exploring Search Facet
---
Search Facet in BroadleafCommerce-demo refers to a feature that allows users to refine search results by applying filters. It is a key component of the search functionality in the e-commerce framework. The SearchFacet interface and its implementations like CategorySearchFacet, CategoryExcludedSearchFacet, and SearchFacetRange provide the necessary methods to get and set search facets. These facets can be associated with categories, have a sequence for ordering, and can be excluded from search. They can also have a range, allowing for more specific filtering of search results.
