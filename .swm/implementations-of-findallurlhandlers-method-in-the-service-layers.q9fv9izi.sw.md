# What is the `findAllURLHandlers` method

The `findAllURLHandlers` method is a part of the `URLHandlerService` interface. It is designed to return a list of all URL handlers. However, caution is advised when using this method due to potential performance and memory issues if there are a large number of records.

```java
    /**
     * Be cautious when calling this.  If there are a large number of records, this can cause performance and
     * memory issues.
     *
     * @return
     */
    public List<URLHandler> findAllURLHandlers();
```

# How is `findAllURLHandlers` used in the codebase

`findAllURLHandlers` is implemented in the `URLHandlerServiceImpl` class. It calls the `findAllURLHandlers` method from the `urlHandlerDao` object, which is responsible for fetching all URL handlers from the database.

```java
    @Override
    public List<URLHandler> findAllURLHandlers() {
        return urlHandlerDao.findAllURLHandlers();
    }
```

# The functionality and purpose of `findAllURLHandlers`

The `findAllURLHandlers` method in the `URLHandlerDao` interface is responsible for fetching all URL handlers configured in the system. This method is called by the `findAllURLHandlers` method in the `URLHandlerServiceImpl` class.

```java
    /**
     * Gets all the URL handlers configured in the system
     *
     * @return
     */
    public List<URLHandler> findAllURLHandlers();
```
