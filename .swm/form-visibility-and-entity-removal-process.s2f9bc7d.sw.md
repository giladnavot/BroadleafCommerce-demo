title: Form Visibility and Entity Removal Process
---
This document will cover the process of managing form visibility and entity removal in the BroadleafCommerce-demo project. We'll cover:

1. How form visibility is set based on certain conditions
2. The process of removing an entity from a form
3. The interaction with the persistence layer during entity removal
4. The role of distributed locks and queues in the process.

# Setting Form Visibility

The `setVisibilityBasedOnShowIfFieldEquals` function is used to dynamically set the visibility of form fields based on certain conditions. If the condition is not met, the field or grid is removed from the form.

# Removing an Entity from a Form

The `removeField` function is called to remove a specific field from a form. This is typically triggered when the visibility condition for the field is not met.

# Interacting with the Persistence Layer

The `remove` and `nonTransactionalRemove` functions interact with the persistence layer to remove the entity from the database. The `getPersistenceManager` function is used to get the current persistence manager.

# Distributed Locks and Queues

The `tryLock` and `lockInternally` functions are used to acquire a distributed lock. This ensures that the entity removal operation is performed atomically across multiple nodes.
