# Maven Project Configuration

The `pom.xml` file is the main configuration file for a Maven project. It defines the project structure, dependencies, build plugins, and other project-specific configurations. In this case, the `pom.xml` file is defining the admin module of the BroadleafCommerce-demo project. It specifies the parent project, artifact details, project description, and the modules included in the admin project.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">

# Admin Module Configuration

The `modules` element in the `pom.xml` file lists the sub-modules of the admin project. These modules include `broadleaf-admin-module`, `broadleaf-open-admin-platform`, `broadleaf-contentmanagement-module`, and `broadleaf-admin-functional-tests`. Each of these modules has its own `pom.xml` file and can be built independently.

```xml
    <modules>
        <module>broadleaf-admin-module</module>
        <module>broadleaf-open-admin-platform</module>
        <module>broadleaf-contentmanagement-module</module>
        <module>broadleaf-admin-functional-tests</module>
    </modules>
```

# Admin Module Usage

The `AdminModule` class is part of the `broadleaf-open-admin-platform` module. It defines the structure of an admin module in the BroadleafCommerce-demo project. The `AdminModule` class is used in various parts of the project to manage and manipulate admin modules.

# Admin Menu Configuration

The `AdminMenu` class is part of the `broadleaf-open-admin-platform` module. It holds the admin menus and sections for which the user has permissions to view. The `AdminMenu` class uses the `AdminModule` class to manage the admin modules.

```java
/**
 * Class to hold the admin menus and sections for which the passed in user has permissions to view.
 * @author bpolster 
 */
public class AdminMenu {

    private List<AdminModule> adminModules = new ArrayList<AdminModule>();

    public List<AdminModule> getAdminModules() {
        return adminModules;
    }

    public void setAdminModule(List<AdminModule> adminModules) {
        this.adminModules = adminModules;
    }
}
```
