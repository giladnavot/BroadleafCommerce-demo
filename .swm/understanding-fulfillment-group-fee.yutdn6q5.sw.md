title: Understanding Fulfillment Group Fee
---
The Fulfillment Group Fee in Broadleaf Commerce refers to additional charges that may be applied to a Fulfillment Group during the order fulfillment process. This could include handling fees, insurance fees, or any other additional charges that need to be applied at the fulfillment group level. The FulfillmentGroupFee interface provides methods to get and set the amount of the fee, the name of the fee, and whether the fee is taxable. It also provides methods to get and set the taxes applied to the fee, and to calculate the total tax for the fee.

## Creating a Fulfillment Group Fee

Here we see the creation of a new Fulfillment Group Fee. This is typically done when a new fee needs to be applied to a Fulfillment Group.

```java
    @Override
    public FulfillmentGroupFee createFulfillmentGroupFee() {
        return ((FulfillmentGroupFee) entityConfiguration.createEntityInstance("org.broadleafcommerce.core.order.domain.FulfillmentGroupFee"));
    }
```

## Setting Properties of a Fulfillment Group Fee

Here we see the methods for setting the amount and name of a Fulfillment Group Fee. These properties are typically set based on the type of fee being applied.

```java
    public Money getAmount();

    public void setAmount(Money amount);

    public String getName();

    public void setName(String name);
```

## Adding a Fulfillment Group Fee to a Fulfillment Group

Here we see a Fulfillment Group Fee being added to a Fulfillment Group. This is typically done after the Fee has been created and its properties set.

```java
    @Override
    public void addFulfillmentGroupFee(FulfillmentGroupFee fulfillmentGroupFee) {
        if (fulfillmentGroupFees == null) {
            fulfillmentGroupFees = new ArrayList<FulfillmentGroupFee>();
        }
```
