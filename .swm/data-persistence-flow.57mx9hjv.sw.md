title: Data Persistence Flow
---
This document will cover the process of handling data persistence in the BroadleafCommerce-demo project. We'll cover:

1. Retrieving the EntityManager
2. Getting the DynamicEntityDao
3. Accessing the PersistenceManager
4. Interacting with the ZookeeperDistributedQueue
5. Managing distributed locks with ReentrantDistributedZookeeperLock.

# Retrieving the EntityManager

The `getEntityManager` function is the starting point of the data persistence flow. It's responsible for retrieving the EntityManager, which is the primary interface for interacting with the persistence context.

# Getting the DynamicEntityDao

The `getDynamicEntityDao` function is called by `getEntityManager`. It retrieves the DynamicEntityDao, which is used to perform operations on dynamic entities.

```java
    protected DynamicEntityDao getDynamicEntityDao(String owningClass) {
        return PersistenceManagerFactory.getPersistenceManager(owningClass).getDynamicEntityDao();
    }
```

# Accessing the PersistenceManager

The `getPersistenceManager` function is called by `getDynamicEntityDao`. It retrieves the PersistenceManager, which provides a set of APIs to interact with the persistence context.

```java
    public PersistenceManager getPersistenceManager() {
        return !persistenceManager.empty()?persistenceManager.peek():null;
    }
```

# Interacting with the ZookeeperDistributedQueue

The `peek` function is called by `getPersistenceManager`. It interacts with the ZookeeperDistributedQueue, which is a distributed queue implementation using Zookeeper. It retrieves the first element in the queue without removing it.

```java
    @Override
    public T peek() {
        try {
            Map<String, T> elements = readQueueInternal(1, false, 0L);
            Iterator<Map.Entry<String, T>> entries = elements.entrySet().iterator();
            if (entries.hasNext()) {
                return entries.next().getValue();
            }
            
            return null;
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            return null;
        }
    }
```

# Managing distributed locks with ReentrantDistributedZookeeperLock

The `lockInterruptibly` function is called within the `readQueueInternal` and `writeToQueue` functions. It manages distributed locks using the ReentrantDistributedZookeeperLock, which is a reentrant lock implementation using Zookeeper.

```java
    @Override
    public void lockInterruptibly() throws InterruptedException {
        if (Thread.interrupted()) {
            throw new InterruptedException("Thread was interrupted prior to trying to acquire the lock.");
        }
        
        lockInternally(-1L);
    }
```
