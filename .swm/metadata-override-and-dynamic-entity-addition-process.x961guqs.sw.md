title: Metadata Override and Dynamic Entity Addition Process
---
This document will cover the process of metadata override and dynamic entity addition in Broadleaf Commerce, which includes:

1. Parsing internal metadata
2. Adding dynamic entities
3. Managing persistence
4. Handling distributed queue operations.

# Parsing Internal Metadata

The `parseInternal` function is the starting point of the flow. It's responsible for parsing the metadata override definitions in the Broadleaf Commerce admin platform.

# Adding Dynamic Entities

The `add` function is called by `parseInternal`. It's responsible for adding dynamic entities to the system. This is done non-transactionally via the `nonTransactionalAdd` function.

```java
    @Override
    public PersistenceResponse nonTransactionalAdd(final PersistencePackage persistencePackage) throws ServiceException {
        return persistenceThreadManager.operation(TargetModeType.SANDBOX, persistencePackage, new Persistable <PersistenceResponse, ServiceException>() {
            @Override
            public PersistenceResponse execute() throws ServiceException {
                boolean shouldClean = isShouldClean();
                if (shouldClean && (CollectionUtils.isEmpty(entitiesIgnoreList) ||
                        !entitiesIgnoreList.contains(persistencePackage.getCeilingEntityFullyQualifiedClassname()))) {
                    cleanEntity(persistencePackage.getEntity());
                }
                try {
                    PersistenceManager persistenceManager = PersistenceManagerFactory.getPersistenceManager();
                    return persistenceManager.add(persistencePackage);
                } catch (ServiceException e) {
                    //immediately throw validation exceptions without printing a stack trace
                    if (e instanceof ValidationException) {
                        throw e;
                    } else if (e.getCause() instanceof ValidationException) {
                        throw (ValidationException) e.getCause();
                    }
                    String message = exploitProtectionService.cleanString(e.getMessage());
```

# Managing Persistence

The `getPersistenceManager` function is called by `nonTransactionalAdd`. It's responsible for retrieving the current persistence manager from the context.

```java
    public PersistenceManager getPersistenceManager() {
        return !persistenceManager.empty()?persistenceManager.peek():null;
    }
```

# Handling Distributed Queue Operations

The `peek` function is called by `getPersistenceManager`. It's responsible for reading the first element from the distributed queue without removing it. This is part of the distributed queue operations handled by Broadleaf Commerce.

```java
    @Override
    public T peek() {
        try {
            Map<String, T> elements = readQueueInternal(1, false, 0L);
            Iterator<Map.Entry<String, T>> entries = elements.entrySet().iterator();
            if (entries.hasNext()) {
                return entries.next().getValue();
            }
            
            return null;
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            return null;
        }
    }
```
