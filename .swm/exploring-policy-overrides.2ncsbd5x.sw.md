title: Exploring Policy Overrides
---
Policy Override in BroadleafCommerce-demo refers to a set of annotations that allow developers to modify the behavior of certain aspects of the application. These annotations include `ClonePolicyCollectionOverride`, `ClonePolicyMapOverride`, and `ClonePolicyAdornedTargetCollectionOverride`. They are used to override the default cloning behavior of collections, maps, and adorned target collections respectively in the Broadleaf Commerce framework. This is particularly useful when you need to customize the way data is copied or cloned in your application.
