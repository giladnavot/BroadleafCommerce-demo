title: Order Payment Creation Process
---
This document will cover the process of creating an order payment from a customer payment in Broadleaf Commerce. The process includes:

1. Adding the payment to the cache
2. Setting the payment status
3. Adding the payment to the distributed queue
4. Writing the payment to the queue
5. Locking the queue for writing

# Adding the payment to the cache

The `add` method is used to add the payment entry to the cache. If the entry does not already exist in the cache, it is added with the current timestamp.

```java
        public Long add(Long entry) {
            if (! cache.containsKey(entry)) {
                return cache.put(entry, new Long(System.currentTimeMillis()));
            }
            return null;
        }
```

# Setting the payment status

The `setType` method is used to set the status of the order payment. The status could be 'PAID', 'PENDING', 'FAILED', etc.

```java
/*-
```

# Adding the payment to the distributed queue

The `add` method is used to add the payment to the distributed queue. If the queue is full, an exception is thrown.

```java
    @Override
    public boolean add(T e) {
        try {
            final ArrayList<T> lst = new ArrayList<>();
            lst.add(e);
            int count = writeToQueue(lst, 0L);
            if (count != 1) {
                throw new IllegalStateException("The Zookeeper queue was full.");
            } else {
                return true;
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException ex) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            return false;
        }
    }
```

# Writing the payment to the queue

The `writeToQueue` method is used to write the payment to the queue. It first acquires a lock on the queue, then writes the payment to the queue, and finally releases the lock.

```java
    protected int writeToQueue(List<? extends T> entries, final long timeout) throws InterruptedException {
        if (entries == null || entries.isEmpty()) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int entryCount = 0;
        long waitTime = timeout;
        synchronized (QUEUE_MONITOR) {
            while (true) {
                boolean locked = false;
                DistributedLock lock = getQueueAccessLock();
                if (timeout < 0L) {
                    lock.lockInterruptibly();
                    locked = true;
                } else if (timeout > 0L && waitTime > 0L) {
                    long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
                    locked = lock.tryLock(waitTime, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
                    long end = System.currentTimeMillis();
                    waitTime -= (end - start);
                } else {
                    locked = lock.tryLock();
```

# Locking the queue for writing

The `lockInterruptibly` method is used to acquire a lock on the queue. If the thread is interrupted before the lock is acquired, an InterruptedException is thrown.

```java
    @Override
    public void lockInterruptibly() throws InterruptedException {
        if (Thread.interrupted()) {
            throw new InterruptedException("Thread was interrupted prior to trying to acquire the lock.");
        }
        
        lockInternally(-1L);
    }
```
