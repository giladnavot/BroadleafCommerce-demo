title: What is Offer Data Access Object
---
OfferDao refers to the Data Access Object (DAO) for the Offer entity. It provides an abstraction of the underlying data access implementation for retrieving and managing Offer objects directly from the database.

OfferDao provides methods for common operations such as save, delete, and create. These methods are used to persist, remove, and instantiate Offer objects respectively.

In addition to these common operations, OfferDao also provides methods for specific queries related to Offer objects, such as readAllOffers, readOfferById, and readOffersByAutomaticDeliveryType. These methods are used to retrieve Offer objects based on specific conditions.

OfferDao is used in various services throughout the application, such as OfferServiceImpl, OfferServiceUtilitiesImpl, and OrderServiceImpl. These services use the methods provided by OfferDao to interact with the Offer data.

# OfferDao

This is the OfferDao interface. It declares methods for CRUD operations and specific queries on Offer objects. The actual implementation of these methods is done in the OfferDaoImpl class.

```java
public interface OfferDao {

    ProratedOrderItemAdjustment save(ProratedOrderItemAdjustment adjustment);

    List<Offer> readAllOffers();

    Offer readOfferById(Long offerId);

    List<Offer> readOffersByAutomaticDeliveryType();

    Offer save(Offer offer);

    void delete(Offer offer);

    Offer create();

    CandidateOrderOffer createCandidateOrderOffer();
    
    CandidateItemOffer createCandidateItemOffer();

    CandidateFulfillmentGroupOffer createCandidateFulfillmentGroupOffer();
```

# OfferDaoImpl

This is the OfferDaoImpl class. It provides the implementation for the methods declared in the OfferDao interface. It uses the EntityManager for interacting with the database.

```java
@Repository("blOfferDao")
public class OfferDaoImpl implements OfferDao {

    @PersistenceContext(unitName="blPU")
    protected EntityManager em;

    @Resource(name="blEntityConfiguration")
    protected EntityConfiguration entityConfiguration;

    @Value("${query.dateResolution.offer:10000}")
    protected Long currentDateResolution;

    protected Date cachedDate = SystemTime.asDate();

    protected Date getCurrentDateAfterFactoringInDateResolution() {
        Date returnDate = SystemTime.getCurrentDateWithinTimeResolution(cachedDate, getCurrentDateResolution());
        if (returnDate != cachedDate) {
            if (SystemTime.shouldCacheDate()) {
                cachedDate = returnDate;
            }
        }
```
