# Role of OfferService in the order processing workflow

`OfferService` is part of the order processing workflow, as indicated by the `addItemWorkflow` resource. This workflow is responsible for adding items to an order.

```java
    /* Workflows */
    @Resource(name = "blAddItemWorkflow")
    protected Processor addItemWorkflow;

# Interaction of OfferService with other services

`OfferService` interacts with other services such as `OrderItemService` and `OrderMultishipOptionService` during the order processing workflow. These services are used to manage order items and multi-ship options respectively.

```java
import org.broadleafcommerce.core.order.service.OrderItemService;
import org.broadleafcommerce.core.order.service.OrderMultishipOptionService;
import org.broadleafcommerce.core.order.service.OrderService;
import org.broadleafcommerce.core.workflow.BaseActivity;
import org.broadleafcommerce.core.workflow.ProcessContext;
```
