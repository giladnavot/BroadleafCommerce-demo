title: Data Field Validation and Management
---
This document will cover the process of validating and managing data fields in the BroadleafCommerce-demo project. The process includes:

1. Validating the basic field type
2. Retrieving the field value
3. Managing the field
4. Persisting the data
5. Managing the queue of data operations.

# Validating the basic field type

The `validate` function in `BasicFieldTypeValidator.java` is the starting point of the flow. It validates the basic field type before any operations are performed on it.

# Retrieving the field value

The `getFieldValue` function retrieves the value of the field from the bean object. It handles the extraction of map fields and applies any field modifiers.

```java
    public Object getFieldValue(Object bean, String fieldName) throws IllegalAccessException, FieldNotAvailableException {
        StringTokenizer tokens = new StringTokenizer(fieldName, ".");
        Class<?> componentClass = bean.getClass();
        Field field = null;
        Object value = HibernateUtils.deproxy(bean);

        while (tokens.hasMoreTokens()) {
            String fieldNamePart = tokens.nextToken();
            String mapKey = null;
            if (fieldNamePart.contains(FieldManager.MAPFIELDSEPARATOR)) {
                mapKey = fieldNamePart.substring(fieldNamePart.indexOf(FieldManager.MAPFIELDSEPARATOR) + FieldManager.MAPFIELDSEPARATOR.length(), fieldNamePart.length());
                fieldNamePart = fieldNamePart.substring(0, fieldNamePart.indexOf(FieldManager.MAPFIELDSEPARATOR));
            }
            field = getSingleField(componentClass, fieldNamePart);

            if (field != null) {
                field.setAccessible(true);
                value = field.get(value);
                value = HibernateUtils.deproxy(value);

                if (mapKey != null) {
```

# Managing the field

The `getFieldManager` function in `AfterStartDateValidator.java` is responsible for managing the field. It retrieves the `FieldManager` instance for further operations.

# Persisting the data

The `getDynamicEntityDao` function in `UniqueValueValidator.java` retrieves the `DynamicEntityDao` instance, which is used to persist the data.

```java
    protected DynamicEntityDao getDynamicEntityDao(String className) {
        return PersistenceManagerFactory.getPersistenceManager(className).getDynamicEntityDao();
    }
}

# Managing the queue of data operations

The `peek` function in `ZookeeperDistributedQueue.java` retrieves the next element in the queue of data operations. It is part of the process of managing the queue of data operations.

```java
    @Override
    public T peek() {
        try {
            Map<String, T> elements = readQueueInternal(1, false, 0L);
            Iterator<Map.Entry<String, T>> entries = elements.entrySet().iterator();
            if (entries.hasNext()) {
                return entries.next().getValue();
            }
            
            return null;
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            return null;
        }
    }
```
