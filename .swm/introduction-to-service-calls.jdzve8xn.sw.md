title: Introduction to Service Calls
---
In the BroadleafCommerce-demo repository, 'Call' refers to a set of operations or methods that are used to manipulate or retrieve data related to a specific service. These operations are encapsulated within the 'call' package under the 'service' directory.

The 'Call' in the 'Service' context is used to perform actions on various entities of the e-commerce application. For instance, the 'setPhone' and 'getPhone' methods are part of the 'FulfillmentGroupRequest' class, which is used to handle requests related to fulfillment groups in the order service.

These methods, 'setPhone' and 'getPhone', are used to set and retrieve the phone information for a fulfillment group respectively. They are used in the 'addFulfillmentGroupToOrder' method in both 'FulfillmentGroupServiceImpl' and 'LegacyOrderServiceImpl' classes.

In summary, 'Call' in the 'Service' context is a crucial part of the BroadleafCommerce-demo repository, enabling the manipulation and retrieval of data for various services in the e-commerce application.
