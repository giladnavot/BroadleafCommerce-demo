# Purpose of `AdminCatalogService`

`AdminCatalogService` is an interface that defines methods for managing product catalog operations. It includes methods for generating SKUs from product options, cloning a product, and more.

```java
public interface AdminCatalogService {

    /**
     * Clear out any Skus that are already attached to the Product
     * if there were any there and generate a new set of Skus based
     * on the permutations of ProductOptions attached to this Product
     *
     * @param productId - the Product to generate Skus from
     * @return the number of generated Skus from the ProductOption permutations
     * @deprecated use {@link #generateSkus(Long)}
     */
    @Deprecated
    public Integer generateSkusFromProduct(Long productId);

    /**
     * Create new Skus based on a product's ProductOptions by permutation and add them to existing ones.
     *
     * @param productId - Product ID to create SKUs
     * @return the map as ResponseBody
     */
    Map<String, Object> generateSkus(Long productId);
```

    @Autowired
