title: Order Fulfillment Process
---
This document will cover the process of handling order fulfillment in the BroadleafCommerce-demo repository. The process includes:

1. Verifying the order
2. Adding the order to the resource purge service
3. Putting the order into the distributed queue
4. Writing the order to the queue
5. Locking the process to avoid data inconsistency
6. Deleting the order from the code type data access object
7. Checking if the order is still in the queue.

# Verifying the order

The `verify` function in `FulfillmentGroupItemStrategyImpl.java` is the starting point of the order fulfillment process. It checks the validity of the order.

# Adding the order to the resource purge service

The `add` function in `ResourcePurgeServiceImpl.java` is called next. It adds the order to a cache if it's not already present.

```java
        public Long add(Long entry) {
            if (! cache.containsKey(entry)) {
                return cache.put(entry, new Long(System.currentTimeMillis()));
            }
            return null;
        }
```

# Putting the order into the distributed queue

The `put` function in `ZookeeperDistributedQueue.java` is then called. It adds the order to a distributed queue for further processing.

```java
    @Override
    public void put(T e) throws InterruptedException {
        final ArrayList<T> elementsToAdd = new ArrayList<>();
        elementsToAdd.add(e);
        writeToQueue(elementsToAdd, -1L);
    }
```

# Writing the order to the queue

The `writeToQueue` function in `ZookeeperDistributedQueue.java` writes the order to the queue. It also handles locking to ensure data consistency.

```java
    protected int writeToQueue(List<? extends T> entries, final long timeout) throws InterruptedException {
        if (entries == null || entries.isEmpty()) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int entryCount = 0;
        long waitTime = timeout;
        synchronized (QUEUE_MONITOR) {
            while (true) {
                boolean locked = false;
                DistributedLock lock = getQueueAccessLock();
                if (timeout < 0L) {
                    lock.lockInterruptibly();
                    locked = true;
                } else if (timeout > 0L && waitTime > 0L) {
                    long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
                    locked = lock.tryLock(waitTime, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
                    long end = System.currentTimeMillis();
                    waitTime -= (end - start);
                } else {
                    locked = lock.tryLock();
```

# Locking the process to avoid data inconsistency

The `lockInterruptibly` function in `ReentrantDistributedZookeeperLock.java` is called to lock the process and avoid data inconsistency.

```java
    @Override
    public void lockInterruptibly() throws InterruptedException {
        if (Thread.interrupted()) {
            throw new InterruptedException("Thread was interrupted prior to trying to acquire the lock.");
        }
        
        lockInternally(-1L);
    }
```

# Deleting the order from the code type data access object

The `delete` function in `CodeTypeDaoImpl.java` is called to delete the order from the data access object.

```java
    public void delete(CodeType codeType) {
        if (!em.contains(codeType)) {
            codeType = (CodeType) em.find(CodeTypeImpl.class, codeType.getId());
        }
        em.remove(codeType);
    }
```

# Checking if the order is still in the queue

Finally, the `contains` function in `ZookeeperDistributedQueue.java` is called to check if the order is still in the queue.

```java
    @Override
    public boolean contains(Object o) {
        return containsAll(Collections.singletonList(o));
    }
```
