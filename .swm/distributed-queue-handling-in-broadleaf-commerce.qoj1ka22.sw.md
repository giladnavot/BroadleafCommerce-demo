title: Distributed Queue Handling in Broadleaf Commerce
---
This document will cover the process of handling distributed queues in the Broadleaf Commerce framework. We'll cover the following steps:

1. Draining the queue
2. Reading the queue
3. Adding to the queue
4. Writing to the queue
5. Locking the queue
6. Deleting the queue.

# Draining the queue

The `drainTo` function starts the process by calling `addAll` to add all elements from the provided collection to the queue. If the collection is null or empty, it returns false.

```java
    @Override
    public boolean addAll(Collection<? extends T> c) {
        if (c == null || c.isEmpty()) {
            return false;
        }
        try {
            int count = writeToQueue(new ArrayList<>(c), -1L);
            return count == c.size();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            return false;
        }
        
    }
```

# Reading the queue

`readQueueInternal` is called next, which locks the queue to prevent other threads from modifying it while it's being read. It then calls `put` to add each element from the collection to the queue.

```java
            lock.lockInterruptibly();
            try {
                executeOperation(new GenericOperation<Void>() {
                    @Override
                    public Void execute() throws Exception {
                        List<String> entryNames = getZookeeperClient().getChildren(getQueueEntryFolder(), null);
                        if (entryNames != null) {
                            for (String entry : entryNames) {
```

# Adding to the queue

`add` is called by `put` to add a single element to the queue. It creates a new ArrayList, adds the element to it, and then writes this list to the queue.

```java
    @Override
    public boolean add(T e) {
        try {
            final ArrayList<T> lst = new ArrayList<>();
            lst.add(e);
            int count = writeToQueue(lst, 0L);
            if (count != 1) {
                throw new IllegalStateException("The Zookeeper queue was full.");
            } else {
                return true;
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException ex) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            return false;
        }
    }
```

# Writing to the queue

`writeToQueue` is responsible for actually writing the elements to the queue. It locks the queue, checks if there's enough capacity, and then writes each element to the queue. If the queue is full, it waits until there's enough capacity.

```java
    protected int writeToQueue(List<? extends T> entries, final long timeout) throws InterruptedException {
        if (entries == null || entries.isEmpty()) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int entryCount = 0;
        long waitTime = timeout;
        synchronized (QUEUE_MONITOR) {
            while (true) {
                boolean locked = false;
                DistributedLock lock = getQueueAccessLock();
                if (timeout < 0L) {
                    lock.lockInterruptibly();
                    locked = true;
                } else if (timeout > 0L && waitTime > 0L) {
                    long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
                    locked = lock.tryLock(waitTime, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
                    long end = System.currentTimeMillis();
                    waitTime -= (end - start);
                } else {
                    locked = lock.tryLock();
```

# Locking the queue

`lockInterruptibly` is used to lock the queue. If the current thread is interrupted while waiting for the lock, it throws an InterruptedException.

```java
    @Override
    public void lockInterruptibly() throws InterruptedException {
        if (Thread.interrupted()) {
            throw new InterruptedException("Thread was interrupted prior to trying to acquire the lock.");
        }
        
        lockInternally(-1L);
    }
```

# Deleting the queue

Finally, `delete` is called to remove the queue from the database.

```java
    public void delete(CodeType codeType) {
        if (!em.contains(codeType)) {
            codeType = (CodeType) em.find(CodeTypeImpl.class, codeType.getId());
        }
        em.remove(codeType);
    }
```
