title: Understanding Structured Content Type
---
A Structured Content Type in Broadleaf Commerce refers to a specific area where content should be targeted. It is typically used for placement, but can also be used to describe the fields. For instance, a content type of 'message' might be used to store messages that can be retrieved by name. A valid content name could be 'homepage banner' or 'cart rhs ad'. The custom fields associated with a Structured Content Type are defined by the `StructuredContentFieldTemplate` associated with it.

# StructuredContentType Interface

This is the StructuredContentType interface. It defines the methods that are available for a Structured Content Type. These methods include getting and setting the ID, name, description, and the associated template of the content type.

```java
/**
 * A content type corresponds to an area where content should be targeted.   For example,
 * a valid content name would be "homepage banner" or "cart rhs ad".
 * <br>
 * While typically used for placement, a content type can also be used just to describe
 * the fields.    For example, a content type of message might be used to store messages
 * that can be retrieved by name.
 * <br>
 * The custom fields associated by with a <code>StructuredContentType</code>
 * <br>
 *
 * @author bpolster.
 */
public interface StructuredContentType extends Serializable,MultiTenantCloneable<StructuredContentType> {

    /**
     * Gets the primary key.
     *
     * @return the primary key
     */
    @Nullable
```

# Usage of StructuredContentType

Here is an example of how StructuredContentType is used in the StructuredContentServiceImpl. The service provides methods to find, retrieve, and save Structured Content Types.

```java
    @Override
    public StructuredContentType findStructuredContentTypeById(Long id) {
        return structuredContentDao.findStructuredContentTypeById(id);
    }

    @Override
    public StructuredContentType findStructuredContentTypeByName(String name) {
        return structuredContentDao.findStructuredContentTypeByName(name);
    }

    @Override
    public List<StructuredContentType> retrieveAllStructuredContentTypes() {
        return structuredContentDao.retrieveAllStructuredContentTypes();
    }

    @Override
    public List<StructuredContent> findContentItems(Criteria c) {
        return c.list();
    }

    @Override
```

    public Long getId();


    /**
     * Sets the primary key.
     *
     * @param id the new primary key
