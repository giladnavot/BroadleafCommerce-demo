title: Overview of SearchResult
---
SearchResult is a class that acts as a container for the results of a ProductSearch or a SkuSearch. It holds a list of products and facets, along with information about the total number of results, the current page, and the size of the page. It also contains a QueryResponse object, which represents the response from a Solr query. The SearchResult class provides methods to get and set these properties, as well as to calculate the start and end result indices and the total number of pages.

# SearchResult Class Structure

The 'SearchResult' class contains fields for the list of products found (`products`), the facets of the search (`facets`), and pagination details (`totalResults`, `page`, `pageSize`). It also includes a `queryResponse` field for the raw response from the search query.

```java
public class SearchResult {
    
    protected List<Product> products;
    protected List<SearchFacetDTO> facets;
    
    protected Integer totalResults;
    protected Integer page;
    protected Integer pageSize;

    protected QueryResponse queryResponse;

    public List<Product> getProducts() {
        return products;
    }

    public void setProducts(List<Product> products) {
        this.products = products;
    }

    public List<SearchFacetDTO> getFacets() {
        return facets;
```

# Using SearchResult in Search Services

The 'SearchResult' class is used in various search services. For example, in the 'SolrSearchServiceImpl' class, 'SearchResult' is used to hold the results of explicit search operations by category.

```java
    @Override
    public SearchResult findExplicitSearchResultsByCategory(Category category, SearchCriteria searchCriteria) throws ServiceException {
        searchCriteria.setSearchExplicitCategory(true);
        searchCriteria.setCategory(category);
        return findSearchResults(searchCriteria);
    }

    @Override
    @Deprecated
    public SearchResult findSearchResultsByCategory(Category category, SearchCriteria searchCriteria) throws ServiceException {
        searchCriteria.setCategory(category);
        return findSearchResults(searchCriteria);
    }

    @Override
    @Deprecated
    public SearchResult findSearchResultsByQuery(String query, SearchCriteria searchCriteria) throws ServiceException {
        searchCriteria.setQuery(query);
        return findSearchResults(searchCriteria);
    }

```

# Accessing Search Results

The 'SearchResult' class's getter methods are used to access the search results. For example, in the 'BroadleafSearchController' class, the 'findSearchResults' method of the search service returns a 'SearchResult' object, and its results are accessed using the 'getProducts' method.

```java
                SearchResult result = getSearchService().findSearchResults(searchCriteria);
```

The `getFacets` method is used to retrieve the list of facets from a search result. The `setFacets` method is used to set the list of facets in a search result.

```java
    public List<SearchFacetDTO> getFacets() {
        return facets;
    }

## getPage and setPage

The `getPage` method is used to retrieve the current page of the search results. The `setPage` method is used to set the current page of the search results.

```java
    public Integer getPage() {

## getStartResult, getEndResult, and getTotalPages

The `getStartResult` method is used to calculate the start result of the search based on the page and page size. The `getEndResult` method is used to calculate the end result of the search based on the page, page size, and total results. The `getTotalPages` method is used to calculate the total number of pages in the search results.

```java
    public Integer getStartResult() {
        return (products == null || products.size() == 0) ? 0 : ((page - 1) * pageSize) + 1;
    }
    
    public Integer getEndResult() {
        return Math.min(page * pageSize, totalResults);
    }
    
    public Integer getTotalPages() {
        return (products == null || products.size() == 0) ? 1 : (int) Math.ceil(totalResults * 1.0 / pageSize);
    }
```
