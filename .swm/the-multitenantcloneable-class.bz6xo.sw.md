# What is MultiTenantCloneable

`MultiTenantCloneable` is an interface in the Broadleaf Commerce framework that describes an entity (or @Embeddable) that is able to be cloned for the purpose of multiple tenancy. It is used to facilitate the creation of copies of entities in a multi-tenant environment.

# Variables and functions

`MultiTenantCloneable` does not have any variables as it is an interface. However, it defines a crucial method `createOrRetrieveCopyInstance`.

## Function: createOrRetrieveCopyInstance

The function `createOrRetrieveCopyInstance` is used to clone an entity for the purpose of multiple tenancy. It takes a `MultiTenantCopyContext` as a parameter and returns a `CreateResponse` object. The `CreateResponse` object contains the cloned entity. If the entity has already been cloned in the current context, the existing clone is returned. This function throws a `CloneNotSupportedException` if there's a problem detected with the cloning configuration.

```java
    /**
     * Clone this entity for the purpose of multiple tenancy. Note, extending classes should follow this pattern:
     * </p>
     * <code>
     * public CreateResponse&lt;MyClass&gt; createOrRetrieveCopyInstance(MultiTenantCopyContext context) throws CloneNotSupportedException {
     *      CreateResponse&lt;MyClass&gt; createResponse = super.createOrRetrieveCopyInstance(context);
     *      if (createResponse.isAlreadyPopulated()) {
     *          return createResponse;
     *      }
     *      MyClass myClone = createResponse.getClone();
     *
     *      //copy extended field values on myClone here
     *
     *      return createResponse;
     * }
     * </code>
     * </p>
     * Support should also be added for @Embeddable classes that contribute fields (collections or basic) to a cloneable entity:
     * </p>
     * <code>
     * public CreateResponse&lt;G extends MyClass&gt; createOrRetrieveCopyInstance(MultiTenantCopyContext context) throws CloneNotSupportedException {
```

# Usage example

`MultiTenantCloneable` is an interface and is meant to be implemented by other classes. Here is an example of how it is used in the `UpSaleProductImpl` class.

<SwmSnippet path="/core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/catalog/domain/UpSaleProductImpl.java" line="1">

---

# Usage example

`UpSaleProductImpl` implements the `MultiTenantCloneable` interface. This means that instances of `UpSaleProductImpl` can be cloned for the purpose of multiple tenancy. The `createOrRetrieveCopyInstance` method would be implemented in this class to handle the specifics of cloning an `UpSaleProductImpl` instance.
