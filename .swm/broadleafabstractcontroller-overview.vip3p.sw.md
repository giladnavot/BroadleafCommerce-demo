# What is BroadleafAbstractController

BroadleafAbstractController is an abstract class that provides convenience methods and resource declarations for its children. It contains operations that are shared between all controllers. If developers want to use composition rather than extension, they can utilize BroadleafControllerUtility.

# Variables and functions

The function `isAjaxRequest` is a helper method that checks whether the given request was invoked via an AJAX call. It takes a HttpServletRequest as a parameter and returns a boolean value indicating whether it was an AJAX request or not.

```java
    protected boolean isAjaxRequest(HttpServletRequest request) {
        return BroadleafControllerUtility.isAjaxRequest(request);       
    }
```

The function `getContextPath` returns the current servlet context path. If the application is deployed as root, it will return a "/". If it's not deployed as root, it will return the context path with both a leading slash but without a trailing slash. It takes a HttpServletRequest as a parameter and returns the context path as a string.

```java
    protected String getContextPath(HttpServletRequest request) {
        String ctxPath = request.getContextPath();
        if (StringUtils.isBlank(ctxPath)) {
            return "/";
        } else {
            if (ctxPath.charAt(0) != '/') {
                ctxPath = '/' + ctxPath;
            }
            if (ctxPath.charAt(ctxPath.length() - 1) != '/') {
                ctxPath = ctxPath + '/';
            }
            
            return ctxPath;
        }
```

The function `addDeepLink` adds a deep link to the model. It takes a ModelAndView, a DeepLinkService, and an item as parameters. If the service is not null and the current sandbox is not null, it gets the links from the service and adds them to the model.

```java
    protected <T> void addDeepLink(ModelAndView model, DeepLinkService<T> service, T item) {
        if (service == null) {
            return;
        }

        BroadleafRequestContext brc = BroadleafRequestContext.getBroadleafRequestContext();
        if (brc.getSandBox() != null) {
            List<DeepLink> links = service.getLinks(item);
            if (links.size() == 1) {
                model.addObject("adminDeepLink", links.get(0));
            } else {
                model.addObject("adminDeepLink", links);
            }
        }
    }
```

The function `jsonResponse` is used to return a JSON response instead of a fully rendered template. It sets the appropriate headers and serializes the given map. It takes a HttpServletResponse and a Map as parameters and throws JsonGenerationException, JsonMappingException, and IOException.

```java
    protected String jsonResponse(HttpServletResponse response, Map<?, ?> responseMap) 
            throws JsonGenerationException, JsonMappingException, IOException {
        response.setHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");
        new ObjectMapper().writeValue(response.getWriter(), responseMap);
        return null;
    }
```

# Usage example

BroadleafPageController is an example of how to use BroadleafAbstractController. It extends BroadleafAbstractController, meaning it inherits all the methods and properties of BroadleafAbstractController.

```java
public class BroadleafPageController extends BroadleafAbstractController implements Controller, TemplateTypeAware {
```
