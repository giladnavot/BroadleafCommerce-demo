title: Counting Total Offers Process
---
This document will cover the process of counting total offers in the BroadleafCommerce-demo repository. The process includes the following steps:

1. Converting offers to IDs
2. Adding the IDs to a cache
3. Putting the IDs into a distributed queue
4. Writing the IDs to the queue
5. Locking the queue for exclusive access
6. Deleting the processed IDs from the database.

# Converting offers to IDs

The `convertOffersToIds` function is used to convert a set of `Offer` objects into a set of their corresponding IDs. This is the first step in the process of counting total offers.

```java
    protected Set<Long> convertOffersToIds(Set<Offer> offers) {
        Set<Long> ids = new HashSet<>();
        for (Offer offer : offers) {
            ids.add(offer.getId());
        }
        return ids;
    }
```

# Adding the IDs to a cache

The `add` function is used to add the offer IDs to a cache. This is done to ensure that the same offer is not processed multiple times.

```java
        public Long add(Long entry) {
            if (! cache.containsKey(entry)) {
                return cache.put(entry, new Long(System.currentTimeMillis()));
            }
            return null;
        }
```

# Putting the IDs into a distributed queue

The `put` function is used to put the offer IDs into a distributed queue. This is done to ensure that the offers are processed in a distributed manner.

```java
    @Override
    public void put(T e) throws InterruptedException {
        final ArrayList<T> elementsToAdd = new ArrayList<>();
        elementsToAdd.add(e);
        writeToQueue(elementsToAdd, -1L);
    }
```

# Writing the IDs to the queue

The `writeToQueue` function is used to write the offer IDs to the queue. This is done to ensure that the offers are processed in the order they were added to the queue.

```java
    protected int writeToQueue(List<? extends T> entries, final long timeout) throws InterruptedException {
        if (entries == null || entries.isEmpty()) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int entryCount = 0;
        long waitTime = timeout;
        synchronized (QUEUE_MONITOR) {
            while (true) {
                boolean locked = false;
                DistributedLock lock = getQueueAccessLock();
                if (timeout < 0L) {
                    lock.lockInterruptibly();
                    locked = true;
                } else if (timeout > 0L && waitTime > 0L) {
                    long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
                    locked = lock.tryLock(waitTime, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
                    long end = System.currentTimeMillis();
                    waitTime -= (end - start);
                } else {
                    locked = lock.tryLock();
```

# Locking the queue for exclusive access

The `lockInterruptibly` function is used to lock the queue for exclusive access. This is done to ensure that the offers are processed one at a time.

```java
    @Override
    public void lockInterruptibly() throws InterruptedException {
        if (Thread.interrupted()) {
            throw new InterruptedException("Thread was interrupted prior to trying to acquire the lock.");
        }
        
        lockInternally(-1L);
    }
```

# Deleting the processed IDs from the database

The `delete` function is used to delete the processed offer IDs from the database. This is done to ensure that the same offer is not processed again.

```java
    public void delete(CodeType codeType) {
        if (!em.contains(codeType)) {
            codeType = (CodeType) em.find(CodeTypeImpl.class, codeType.getId());
        }
        em.remove(codeType);
    }
```
