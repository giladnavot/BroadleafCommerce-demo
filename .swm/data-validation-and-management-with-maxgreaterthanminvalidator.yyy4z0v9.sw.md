title: Data Validation and Management with MaxGreaterThanMinValidator
---
This document will cover the process of validating and managing data in Broadleaf Commerce, specifically focusing on the `MaxGreaterThanMinValidator` class. The topics we will cover are:

1. The purpose of the `MaxGreaterThanMinValidator` class.
2. How the `MaxGreaterThanMinValidator` interacts with other classes.
3. The flow of data validation and management.

# Purpose of the MaxGreaterThanMinValidator Class

The `MaxGreaterThanMinValidator` class is a part of Broadleaf's data validation system. It ensures that the maximum value of a given field is greater than the minimum value. This is crucial in various scenarios such as price range validation, quantity checks, etc.

# Interaction with Other Classes

`MaxGreaterThanMinValidator` interacts with other classes like `FieldManager` and `UniqueValueValidator` to fetch field values and ensure their uniqueness respectively. This is part of the broader data validation and management process.

```java
        FieldManager fm = getFieldManager(propertyMetadata);
        boolean valid = true;
        String message = "";
        BigDecimal min = new BigDecimal(0);
        BigDecimal max = min;

        if (StringUtils.isBlank(value) || StringUtils.isBlank(otherField)) {
            return new PropertyValidationResult(true);
        }

        try {
            Object minObj = fm.getFieldValue(instance, otherField);
            if (minObj != null) {
                min = new BigDecimal(minObj.toString());
            }
            max = new BigDecimal(fm.getFieldValue(instance, propertyName).toString());
        } catch (IllegalAccessException | FieldNotAvailableException e) {
            valid = false;
            message = e.getMessage();
        }

```

# Data Validation and Management Flow

The data validation and management process starts with the `MaxGreaterThanMinValidator` class, which calls the `getFieldValue` method from the `FieldManager` class to fetch the field value. It then interacts with the `UniqueValueValidator` class to ensure the uniqueness of the value. The process continues with various other classes and methods, ultimately ensuring the data is valid and properly managed.
