title: Getting Started with the Broadleaf Open Admin Platform
---
The Broadleaf Open Admin Platform is a part of the Broadleaf Commerce framework, designed to provide a robust and customizable administrative interface for managing e-commerce operations. It is implemented in Java and is part of the broader Broadleaf Commerce framework. The platform includes features for managing products, customers, orders, and other aspects of an e-commerce system.

The platform's codebase is organized into several packages and directories, including `org.broadleafcommerce.openadmin.web.filter`, `org.broadleafcommerce.openadmin.server.security.domain`, and `org.broadleafcommerce.openadmin.server.security.service`, among others. These packages contain classes and resources that implement various functionalities of the admin platform.

The `BroadleafAdminRequestProcessor.java` file, for example, contains constants used across the platform, such as `SANDBOX_REQ_PARAM`, `CATALOG_REQ_PARAM`, and `ADMIN_STRICT_VALIDATE_PRODUCTION_CHANGES_KEY`. These constants are used to manage request parameters and configuration settings within the platform.

The platform also includes a `pom.xml` file, which is a Project Object Model file used by Maven to manage the project's build, report, and documentation. This file specifies the project structure, dependencies, plugins, and other configuration details.

The `OpenAdminMessages.properties` file is a resource bundle that contains localized messages used in the admin interface. For example, `Admin_Title` is the key for the title of the admin interface, which is 'Broadleaf Admin'.

# Admin User Security

The `BroadleafAdminRequestProcessor` class in the `org.broadleafcommerce.openadmin.web.filter` package is an example of how the Broadleaf open admin platform handles security. It imports the `AdminUser` class from the `org.broadleafcommerce.openadmin.server.security.domain` package, which represents an admin user in the system.

```java
import org.broadleafcommerce.common.web.DeployBehavior;
import org.broadleafcommerce.common.web.ValidateProductionChangesState;
import org.broadleafcommerce.openadmin.server.security.domain.AdminUser;
import org.broadleafcommerce.openadmin.server.security.remote.SecurityVerifier;
import org.broadleafcommerce.openadmin.server.security.service.AdminSecurityService;
```

# Admin Interface Localization

The `OpenAdminMessages.properties` file in the `resources/messages` directory is used for localizing the admin interface. For example, the `Admin_Title` key is used to set the title of the admin interface.

```ini
Admin_Title=Broadleaf Admin
```
