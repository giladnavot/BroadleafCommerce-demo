title: Understanding Search Synonym
---
Search Synonym is an interface in the Broadleaf Commerce framework that is used to manage synonyms for search terms. It provides methods to get and set the term, and to get and set an array of synonyms for the term. This allows the search functionality to return results that not only match the exact search term, but also its synonyms, enhancing the user's search experience.
