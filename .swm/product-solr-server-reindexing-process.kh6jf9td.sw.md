This document will cover the Solr Server Reindexing Process, which includes:

1. Retrieving the Solr server for reindexing
2. Checking and creating the collection if it doesn't exist
3. Handling exceptions during the process
4. Checking if the exception message is empty.

# Retrieving the Solr server for reindexing

The first step in the Solr Server Reindexing Process is to retrieve the Solr server that will be used for reindexing. This involves connecting to the primary Solr server and checking if the site has a specific reindex alias. If such an alias exists, the system checks and creates the collection and alias if they don't exist. This ensures that the correct server is used for reindexing, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity and performance of the search functionality.

# Checking and creating the collection if it doesn't exist

The next step is to check if the collection exists in the Solr server. If it doesn't, the system attempts to create the collection. This is important because the collection is where the indexed data is stored. If the collection doesn't exist, the reindexing process would fail. Therefore, by ensuring the collection exists, we ensure the reindexing process can be successfully completed.

# Handling exceptions during the process

During the reindexing process, exceptions may occur. These exceptions are handled by refining the exception. This involves checking if the exception is of a specified type and wrapping it. If the exception has a cause, it recursively refines the cause. This is important because it allows us to handle exceptions in a controlled manner and prevent them from disrupting the reindexing process.

# Checking if the exception message is empty

The final step in the process is to check if the exception message is empty. This is done to ensure that any exceptions that occur during the reindexing process are properly logged and can be reviewed for troubleshooting purposes. By checking if the exception message is empty, we can ensure that all exceptions are properly documented, which aids in identifying and resolving issues.
