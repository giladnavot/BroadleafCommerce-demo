title: Exploring the Payment Domain
---
Domain in the Payment package refers to the data model layer of the Broadleaf Commerce application. It contains classes that represent the core business objects in the payment processing flow, such as OrderPayment, PaymentTransaction, and PaymentResponseItem.

These classes are used to capture and manage all the details related to a payment transaction. For example, OrderPayment represents a payment associated with an order, PaymentTransaction represents a specific transaction for a payment, and PaymentResponseItem holds the response details from a payment gateway.

The domain package also includes secure subpackage that contains classes for handling sensitive payment information. For instance, CreditCardPaymentInfoImpl class is used to store and manage credit card payment details in a secure way.

# Domain in Payment Package

This is an example of a domain interface in the payment package. The `Referenced` interface is used to store extra-secure data such as credit card, bank accounts, and gift card data. It provides methods to get and set the id, reference number, and encryption module. Entities that implement this interface should be stored in a completely separate database under strict PCI compliance.

```java
/**
 * <p>The main interface used to store extra-secure data such as credit card, bank accounts and gift card data. All entities
 * that implement this interface should be stored in a completely separate database under strict PCI compliance. Broadleaf
 * provides the ability for this in the blSecurePU persistence unit, which all implementing entities are members of.</p>
 *
 * <p>Entities that implement this {@link Referenced} interface should not be instantiated directly but rather be instaniated
 * via {@link SecureOrderPaymentService#create(org.broadleafcommerce.core.payment.service.type.PaymentType)}</p>
 * 
 * <p>In the common case, this is rarely used as most implementors will NOT want to deal with the liability and extra PCI
 * requirements associated with storing sensitive payment data. Consider integrating with a payment provider that takes
 * care of PCI-sensitive data instead.</p>
 *
 * @see {@link CreditCardPayment}
 * @see {@link GiftCardPayment}
 * @see {@link BankAccountPayment}

# Secure Subpackage in Domain

The domain package also includes a secure subpackage that contains classes for handling sensitive payment information. These classes, like `CreditCardPaymentInfoImpl`, are used to store and manage payment details in a secure way. They are part of the `blSecurePU` persistence unit, which is under strict PCI compliance.
