# What is AdminMainEntity

`AdminMainEntity` is an interface in the Broadleaf Commerce framework. It is designed to provide a method for determining the display name of an entity in the admin screen. Entities that implement this interface will have their `getMainEntityName()` method invoked to determine their title when they are viewed in the admin interface.

# Variables and functions

The `MAIN_ENTITY_NAME_PROPERTY` is a constant string that is used as a property key to store the main entity name.

```java
    public static final String MAIN_ENTITY_NAME_PROPERTY = "__adminMainEntity";
```

The `getMainEntityName()` function is a method that should be implemented by classes that implement the `AdminMainEntity` interface. It is used to return the display name of the entity for the admin screen.

```java
    public String getMainEntityName();
```

# Usage example

`SandBoxImpl` is an example of a class that implements the `AdminMainEntity` interface. This means that it provides an implementation for the `getMainEntityName()` method, which is used to determine its display name in the admin interface.

```java
public class SandBoxImpl implements SandBox, AdminMainEntity {
```
