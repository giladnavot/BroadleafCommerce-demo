title: JSON Facet Resolution Process
---
This document will cover the process of resolving JSON facet responses in the Broadleaf Commerce framework, which includes:

1. Resolving the JSON facet response
2. Getting the key for the facet
3. Adding the resolved facet to the distributed queue
4. Writing the facet to the queue
5. Locking the queue for writing
6. Deleting the lock once writing is complete.

# Resolving the JSON facet response

The `resolveJSONFacetResponse` function is the entry point for this flow. It is responsible for resolving the JSON facet response from the Solr search engine.

# Getting the key for the facet

The `getKey` function is called to get the key for the facet. This key is used to identify the facet in the Solr search engine.

```java
            @Override
            public String getKey(SearchFacetDTO facet) {
                return getPropertyNameForIndexField(facet.getFacet().getFieldType().getIndexField(),
                        FieldType.getInstance(facet.getFacet().getFacetFieldType()));
            }
```

# Adding the resolved facet to the distributed queue

The `add` function is called to add the resolved facet to the distributed queue. This queue is used to store the facets until they are written to the Solr search engine.

```java
    @Override
    public boolean add(T e) {
        try {
            final ArrayList<T> lst = new ArrayList<>();
            lst.add(e);
            int count = writeToQueue(lst, 0L);
            if (count != 1) {
                throw new IllegalStateException("The Zookeeper queue was full.");
            } else {
                return true;
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException ex) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            return false;
        }
    }
```

# Writing the facet to the queue

The `writeToQueue` function is called to write the facet to the queue. This function locks the queue for writing, writes the facet, and then unlocks the queue.

```java
    protected int writeToQueue(List<? extends T> entries, final long timeout) throws InterruptedException {
        if (entries == null || entries.isEmpty()) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int entryCount = 0;
        long waitTime = timeout;
        synchronized (QUEUE_MONITOR) {
            while (true) {
                boolean locked = false;
                DistributedLock lock = getQueueAccessLock();
                if (timeout < 0L) {
                    lock.lockInterruptibly();
                    locked = true;
                } else if (timeout > 0L && waitTime > 0L) {
                    long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
                    locked = lock.tryLock(waitTime, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
                    long end = System.currentTimeMillis();
                    waitTime -= (end - start);
                } else {
                    locked = lock.tryLock();
```

# Locking the queue for writing

The `lockInterruptibly` function is called to lock the queue for writing. This ensures that only one process can write to the queue at a time.

```java
    @Override
    public void lockInterruptibly() throws InterruptedException {
        if (Thread.interrupted()) {
            throw new InterruptedException("Thread was interrupted prior to trying to acquire the lock.");
        }
        
        lockInternally(-1L);
    }
```

# Deleting the lock once writing is complete

The `delete` function is called to delete the lock once writing is complete. This allows other processes to write to the queue.

```java
    public void delete(CodeType codeType) {
        if (!em.contains(codeType)) {
            codeType = (CodeType) em.find(CodeTypeImpl.class, codeType.getId());
        }
        em.remove(codeType);
    }
```
