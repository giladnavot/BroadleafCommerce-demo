title: The MultiTenantCloneable Interface

This document will cover the following aspects of the `MultiTenantCloneable` interface:

1. What is `MultiTenantCloneable`.
2. The variables and functions defined in `MultiTenantCloneable`.
3. An example of how `MultiTenantCloneable` is used in `UpSaleProductImpl`.

# What is MultiTenantCloneable

`MultiTenantCloneable` is an interface in the Broadleaf Commerce framework that describes an entity (or @Embeddable) that is able to be cloned for the purpose of multiple tenancy. It is used to facilitate the creation of copies of entities in a multi-tenant environment.

# Variables and functions

`MultiTenantCloneable` does not define any variables as it is an interface. However, it does define a single method, `createOrRetrieveCopyInstance`.

## The `createOrRetrieveCopyInstance` function

The `createOrRetrieveCopyInstance` method is used to clone an entity for the purpose of multiple tenancy. It takes a `MultiTenantCopyContext` as a parameter and returns a `CreateResponse` object. The `CreateResponse` object contains the cloned entity and a flag indicating whether the entity was already populated. This method throws a `CloneNotSupportedException` if there's a problem detected with the cloning configuration.

```java
    /**
     * Clone this entity for the purpose of multiple tenancy. Note, extending classes should follow this pattern:
     * </p>
     * <code>
     * public CreateResponse&lt;MyClass&gt; createOrRetrieveCopyInstance(MultiTenantCopyContext context) throws CloneNotSupportedException {
     *      CreateResponse&lt;MyClass&gt; createResponse = super.createOrRetrieveCopyInstance(context);
     *      if (createResponse.isAlreadyPopulated()) {
     *          return createResponse;
     *      }
     *      MyClass myClone = createResponse.getClone();
     *
     *      //copy extended field values on myClone here
     *
     *      return createResponse;
     * }
     * </code>
     * </p>
     * Support should also be added for @Embeddable classes that contribute fields (collections or basic) to a cloneable entity:
     * </p>
     * <code>
     * public CreateResponse&lt;G extends MyClass&gt; createOrRetrieveCopyInstance(MultiTenantCopyContext context) throws CloneNotSupportedException {
```

# Usage example

`UpSaleProductImpl` is an example of a class that implements the `MultiTenantCloneable` interface. It uses the `createOrRetrieveCopyInstance` method to create a copy of an `UpSaleProductImpl` instance for multiple tenancy.
