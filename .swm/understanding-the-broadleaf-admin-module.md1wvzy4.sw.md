title: Understanding the Broadleaf Admin Module
---
The Broadleaf admin module is a key component of the Broadleaf Commerce framework. It is responsible for providing the administrative functionalities of the e-commerce application. This includes managing products, categories, and other commerce-related entities. The module is defined in the `AdminModuleRegistration` class, which implements the `BroadleafModuleRegistration` interface. The module's name is defined as 'Admin'. The admin module is registered in the `spring.factories` file, which allows Spring to automatically discover it during the application startup.

The admin module is organized into several packages, each responsible for a specific aspect of the admin functionality. For example, the `org.broadleafcommerce.admin.server.service` package contains services related to the admin functionality, such as `AdminCatalogService` which likely handles operations related to the product catalog. The `org.broadleafcommerce.admin.web.controller.entity` package contains web controllers for handling HTTP requests related to entities like products.

The admin module is built as a Maven project, as indicated by the `pom.xml` file. This file defines the module's dependencies, build configuration, and other project-specific settings. The module depends on other Broadleaf modules like `broadleaf-framework` and `broadleaf-open-admin-platform`, as well as other common libraries.

# AdminModuleRegistration Class

The `AdminModuleRegistration` class is a key part of the Broadleaf admin module. It implements the `BroadleafModuleRegistration` interface and provides the module name, which is 'Admin'. This class is used to register the admin module with the Broadleaf Commerce framework.

```java
/**
 * @author Brandon Hines
 */
public class AdminModuleRegistration implements BroadleafModuleRegistration {

    public static final String MODULE_NAME = "Admin";

    @Override
    public String getModuleName() {
        return MODULE_NAME;
    }

}
```

# AdminModuleRegistration in spring.factories

The `AdminModuleRegistration` class is registered as a `BroadleafModuleRegistration` in the `spring.factories` file. This allows the Broadleaf Commerce framework to recognize and load the admin module during startup.

```factories
org.broadleafcommerce.common.module.BroadleafModuleRegistration=org.broadleafcommerce.admin.config.AdminModuleRegistration
```

# Admin Module's pom.xml

The `pom.xml` file for the Broadleaf admin module defines the module's Maven configuration, including its parent project, artifact ID, and dependencies. This file is crucial for building and packaging the admin module.

```xml
