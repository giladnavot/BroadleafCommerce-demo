title: Understanding Structured Content Rule
---
The StructuredContentRule in BroadleafCommerce-demo refers to a rule used to determine if a StructuredContent item should be displayed. It is represented as a valid MVEL string. The Content Management System by default is able to process rules based on the current customer, product, time, or request. It also includes methods to get and set the primary key, and to clone the rule, which is used by the content management system when an item is edited.

# StructuredContentRule Interface

This is the StructuredContentRule interface. It extends SimpleRule and MultiTenantCloneable. It provides methods to get and set the primary key, and to clone the rule.

```java
/**
 * Implementations hold the values for a rule used to determine if a <code>StructuredContent</code>
 * item should be displayed.
 * <br>
 * The rule is represented as a valid MVEL string.    The Content Management System by default
 * is able to process rules based on the current customer, product,
 * {@link org.broadleafcommerce.common.TimeDTO time}, or {@link org.broadleafcommerce.common.RequestDTO request}
 *
 * @see org.broadleafcommerce.cms.web.structure.DisplayContentTag
 * @see org.broadleafcommerce.cms.structure.service.StructuredContentServiceImpl#evaluateAndPriortizeContent(java.util.List, int, java.util.Map)
 * @author jfischer
 * @author bpolster
 *
 */
public interface StructuredContentRule extends SimpleRule,MultiTenantCloneable<StructuredContentRule> {

    /**
     * Gets the primary key.
     *
     * @return the primary key
     */
```
