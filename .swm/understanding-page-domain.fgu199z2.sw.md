title: Understanding Page Domain
---
Page Domain in BroadleafCommerce-demo refers to a package that contains classes related to the management of pages in the e-commerce framework. This includes classes for page rules, templates, fields, attributes, and more. These classes provide the functionality for creating, managing, and displaying pages on the e-commerce site.

For example, the `Page` class represents a page on the website, while the `PageTemplate` class represents the template used to render the page. The `PageRule` class is used to define rules for when a page should be displayed, and the `PageField` and `PageAttribute` classes are used to manage custom fields and attributes for pages.

Overall, the Page Domain package is a crucial part of the BroadleafCommerce-demo, as it provides the necessary functionality for managing the pages of the e-commerce site.
