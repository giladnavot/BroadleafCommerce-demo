title: Saving Multi-ship Options in an Order
---
This document will cover the process of saving multi-ship options in an order, which includes:

1. Adding the order to the resource purge service
2. Adding the order to the distributed queue
3. Writing the order to the queue
4. Locking the queue
5. Deleting the order from the code type DAO
6. Checking if the order is still in the queue.

# Adding the order to the resource purge service

The `add` function in `ResourcePurgeServiceImpl` is used to add the order to a cache. If the order is not already in the cache, it is added with the current time as its value.

```java
        public Long add(Long entry) {
            if (! cache.containsKey(entry)) {
                return cache.put(entry, new Long(System.currentTimeMillis()));
            }
            return null;
        }
```

# Adding the order to the distributed queue

The `add` function in `ZookeeperDistributedQueue` is used to add the order to a distributed queue. If the queue is full, an exception is thrown.

```java
    @Override
    public boolean add(T e) {
        try {
            final ArrayList<T> lst = new ArrayList<>();
            lst.add(e);
            int count = writeToQueue(lst, 0L);
            if (count != 1) {
                throw new IllegalStateException("The Zookeeper queue was full.");
            } else {
                return true;
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException ex) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            return false;
        }
    }
```

# Writing the order to the queue

The `writeToQueue` function in `ZookeeperDistributedQueue` is used to write the order to the queue. It uses a distributed lock to ensure that only one process can write to the queue at a time.

```java
    protected int writeToQueue(List<? extends T> entries, final long timeout) throws InterruptedException {
        if (entries == null || entries.isEmpty()) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int entryCount = 0;
        long waitTime = timeout;
        synchronized (QUEUE_MONITOR) {
            while (true) {
                boolean locked = false;
                DistributedLock lock = getQueueAccessLock();
                if (timeout < 0L) {
                    lock.lockInterruptibly();
                    locked = true;
                } else if (timeout > 0L && waitTime > 0L) {
                    long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
                    locked = lock.tryLock(waitTime, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
                    long end = System.currentTimeMillis();
                    waitTime -= (end - start);
                } else {
                    locked = lock.tryLock();
```

# Locking the queue

The `lockInterruptibly` function in `ReentrantDistributedZookeeperLock` is used to lock the queue. If the thread is interrupted before the lock can be acquired, an `InterruptedException` is thrown.

```java
    @Override
    public void lockInterruptibly() throws InterruptedException {
        if (Thread.interrupted()) {
            throw new InterruptedException("Thread was interrupted prior to trying to acquire the lock.");
        }
        
        lockInternally(-1L);
    }
```

# Deleting the order from the code type DAO

The `delete` function in `CodeTypeDaoImpl` is used to delete the order from the code type DAO. If the order is not in the DAO, it is first retrieved before being deleted.

```java
    public void delete(CodeType codeType) {
        if (!em.contains(codeType)) {
            codeType = (CodeType) em.find(CodeTypeImpl.class, codeType.getId());
        }
        em.remove(codeType);
    }
```

# Checking if the order is still in the queue

The `contains` function in `ZookeeperDistributedQueue` is used to check if the order is still in the queue.

```java
    @Override
    public boolean contains(Object o) {
        return containsAll(Collections.singletonList(o));
    }
```
