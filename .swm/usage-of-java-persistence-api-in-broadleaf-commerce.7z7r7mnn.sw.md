title: Usage of Java Persistence API in Broadleaf Commerce
---
This document will cover how Broadleaf uses JPA in its implementation. We'll cover:

1. The role of JPA in Broadleaf's extensibility
2. How JPA is used in Broadleaf's core catalog domain
3. The use of JPA in Broadleaf's inventory domain.

# JPA in Broadleaf's Extensibility

Broadleaf uses JPA extensively in its extensibility framework. The `MergePersistenceUnitManager` class is a key part of this, managing the persistence units that are used when merging changes from different sources.

# JPA in Broadleaf's Core Catalog Domain

In Broadleaf's core catalog domain, JPA is used to map the `ProductImpl` class to the `BLC_PRODUCT` table in the database. This includes specifying relationships with other entities, such as `CategoryProductXrefImpl`.

# JPA in Broadleaf's Inventory Domain

In the inventory domain, the `SkuAvailabilityImpl` class uses JPA to map to the `BLC_SKU_AVAILABILITY` table. This includes specifying the relationships with other entities, such as `SkuImpl`.
