# Key methods of StructuredContentDao

`StructuredContentDao` provides several methods for managing `StructuredContent` and `StructuredContentType`. These include methods for finding content by ID or name, retrieving all content types, adding or updating content items, deleting content items, and more.

```java
    public StructuredContent findStructuredContentById(Long contentId);

    /**
     * Returns the <code>StructuredContentType</code> that matches
     * the passed in contentTypeId.
     * @param contentTypeId
     * @return the found item or null if it does not exist
     */
    public StructuredContentType findStructuredContentTypeById(Long contentTypeId);

    /**
     * Returns the list of all <code>StructuredContentType</code>s.
     *
     * @return the list of found items
     */
    public List<StructuredContentType> retrieveAllStructuredContentTypes();
    
    /**
     * Finds all content regardless of the {@link Sandbox} they are a member of
     * @return the list of {@link StructuredContent}, an empty list of none are found
     */
```
