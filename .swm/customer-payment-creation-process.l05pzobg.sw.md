title: Customer Payment Creation Process
---
This document will explain the process of creating a customer payment from a response DTO in the BroadleafCommerce-demo project. The process involves the following steps:

1. Creating a new customer payment
2. Populating the customer payment
3. Adding the payment to a distributed queue
4. Writing the payment to the queue
5. Locking the queue to prevent concurrent modifications
6. Deleting the lock once the operation is complete.

# Creating a new customer payment

The `createCustomerPaymentFromResponseDTO` function is the entry point for this process. It creates a new customer payment object based on the information contained in the response DTO.

# Populating the customer payment

The `populateCustomerPayment` function is called to populate the newly created customer payment object with the necessary details.

# Adding the payment to a distributed queue

The `add` function is used to add the customer payment to a distributed queue. This ensures that the payment is processed in a thread-safe manner.

```java
    @Override
    public boolean add(T e) {
        try {
            final ArrayList<T> lst = new ArrayList<>();
            lst.add(e);
            int count = writeToQueue(lst, 0L);
            if (count != 1) {
                throw new IllegalStateException("The Zookeeper queue was full.");
            } else {
                return true;
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException ex) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            return false;
        }
    }
```

# Writing the payment to the queue

The `writeToQueue` function is responsible for writing the customer payment to the queue. It uses a lock to ensure that no other thread can modify the queue while the payment is being written.

```java
    protected int writeToQueue(List<? extends T> entries, final long timeout) throws InterruptedException {
        if (entries == null || entries.isEmpty()) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int entryCount = 0;
        long waitTime = timeout;
        synchronized (QUEUE_MONITOR) {
            while (true) {
                boolean locked = false;
                DistributedLock lock = getQueueAccessLock();
                if (timeout < 0L) {
                    lock.lockInterruptibly();
                    locked = true;
                } else if (timeout > 0L && waitTime > 0L) {
                    long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
                    locked = lock.tryLock(waitTime, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
                    long end = System.currentTimeMillis();
                    waitTime -= (end - start);
                } else {
                    locked = lock.tryLock();
```

# Locking the queue to prevent concurrent modifications

The `lockInterruptibly` function is used to acquire a lock on the queue. This prevents other threads from modifying the queue while the payment is being written.

```java
    @Override
    public void lockInterruptibly() throws InterruptedException {
        if (Thread.interrupted()) {
            throw new InterruptedException("Thread was interrupted prior to trying to acquire the lock.");
        }
        
        lockInternally(-1L);
    }
```

# Deleting the lock once the operation is complete

The `delete` function is called to delete the lock once the payment has been successfully written to the queue. This allows other threads to modify the queue.

```java
    public void delete(CodeType codeType) {
        if (!em.contains(codeType)) {
            codeType = (CodeType) em.find(CodeTypeImpl.class, codeType.getId());
        }
        em.remove(codeType);
    }
```
