title: Order Tax Calculation Process
---
This document will cover the process of calculating and applying tax for an order in the BroadleafCommerce-demo repository. The process involves the following steps:

1. Calculating tax for an order
2. Handling taxes for fulfillment group items
3. Applying tax factor
4. Setting the type of shipping service
5. Adding the calculated tax to a distributed queue

# Calculating tax for an order

The `calculateTaxForOrder` function initiates the tax calculation process. It calls `handleFulfillmentGroupItemTaxes`, `handleFulfillmentGroupFeeTaxes`, and `handleFulfillmentGroupTaxes` to calculate taxes for different components of the order.

```java
    protected void handleFulfillmentGroupItemTaxes(FulfillmentGroup fulfillmentGroup) {
        for (FulfillmentGroupItem fgItem : fulfillmentGroup.getFulfillmentGroupItems()) {
            if (isItemTaxable(fgItem)) {
                applyTaxFactor(fgItem.getTaxes(), determineItemTaxRate(fulfillmentGroup.getAddress()), fgItem.getTotalItemTaxableAmount());
            }
        }
    }
```

# Handling taxes for fulfillment group items

`handleFulfillmentGroupItemTaxes` is responsible for calculating taxes for each item in the fulfillment group. It checks if the item is taxable and then applies the tax factor to the taxable amount of the item.

```java
    protected void handleFulfillmentGroupItemTaxes(FulfillmentGroup fulfillmentGroup) {
        for (FulfillmentGroupItem fgItem : fulfillmentGroup.getFulfillmentGroupItems()) {
            if (isItemTaxable(fgItem)) {
                applyTaxFactor(fgItem.getTaxes(), determineItemTaxRate(fulfillmentGroup.getAddress()), fgItem.getTotalItemTaxableAmount());
            }
        }
    }
```

# Applying tax factor

`applyTaxFactor` applies the calculated tax factor to the taxable amount. If the tax factor is non-zero, it either updates the existing tax record or creates a new one. If the tax factor is zero, it removes the existing tax record.

```java
    protected void applyTaxFactor(List<TaxDetail> taxes, BigDecimal taxFactor, Money taxMultiplier) {
        TaxDetail tax = findExistingTaxDetail(taxes);
        boolean shouldUpdateOrCreateTaxRecord = taxFactor != null && taxFactor.compareTo(BigDecimal.ZERO) != 0;
        boolean shouldRemoveTaxRecord = (taxFactor == null || taxFactor.compareTo(BigDecimal.ZERO) == 0) && tax != null;
        if (shouldUpdateOrCreateTaxRecord) {
            if (tax == null) {
                tax = entityConfig.createEntityInstance(TaxDetail.class.getName(), TaxDetail.class);
                tax.setType(TaxType.COMBINED);
                taxes.add(tax);
            }
            tax.setRate(taxFactor);
            tax.setAmount(taxMultiplier.multiply(taxFactor));
        } else if (shouldRemoveTaxRecord) {
            taxes.remove(tax);
        }
    }
```

# Setting the type of shipping service

`setType` sets the type of the shipping service. This is important as different types of shipping services may have different tax rates.

# Adding the calculated tax to a distributed queue

The `put` function adds the calculated tax to a distributed queue. This queue can be used to process the tax information asynchronously.

```java
    @Override
    public void put(T e) throws InterruptedException {
        final ArrayList<T> elementsToAdd = new ArrayList<>();
        elementsToAdd.add(e);
        writeToQueue(elementsToAdd, -1L);
    }
```
