# AdminOrderController Class

The AdminOrderController class handles admin operations for the Order entity. It extends the AdminBasicEntityController class, which provides basic CRUD operations. The class is annotated with @Controller, indicating that it's a Spring MVC Controller, and @RequestMapping, which maps HTTP requests to handler methods of MVC and REST controllers.

```java

@RequestMapping("/" + AdminOrderController.SECTION_KEY)
public class AdminOrderController extends AdminBasicEntityController {
    
    public static final String SECTION_KEY = "order";
    
    @Override
    protected String getSectionKey(Map<String, String> pathVars) {
        //allow external links to work for ToOne items
        if (super.getSectionKey(pathVars) != null) {
            return super.getSectionKey(pathVars);
        }
        return SECTION_KEY;
    }
