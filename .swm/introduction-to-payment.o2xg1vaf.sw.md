title: Introduction to Payment
---
Payment in BroadleafCommerce-demo refers to the process of handling transactions related to the purchase of products in the e-commerce platform. It involves various components such as OrderPayment, PaymentTransaction, and different types of payment methods like credit card, gift card, etc. The PaymentTransaction interface is used to store individual transactions about a particular payment, while the OrderPayment interface holds data like what the user might be paying with and the total amount they will be paying. These interfaces are used across the codebase to manage and process payments.

# PaymentTransaction Interface

The PaymentTransaction interface defines the structure and behavior of a payment transaction. It includes methods for getting and setting properties such as the ID, the associated OrderPayment, the parent transaction, the type of transaction, the amount, the date, the customer's IP address, the raw response from the payment gateway, and whether the transaction was successful.

```java
/**
 * <p>Used to store individual transactions about a particular payment. While an {@link OrderPayment} holds data like what the
 * user might be paying with and the total amount they will be paying (like credit card and $10), a {@link PaymentTransaction}
 * is more about what happens with that particular payment. Thus, {@link PaymentTransaction}s do not make sense by
 * themselves and ONLY make sense in the context of an {@link OrderPayment}.</p>
 * 
 * <p>For instance, the user might say they want to pay $10 but rather than capture the payment at order checkout, there
 * might first be a transaction for {@link PaymentTransactionType#AUTHORIZE} and then when the item is shipped there is
 * another {@link PaymentTransaction} for {@link PaymentTransactionType#CAPTURE}.</p>
 * 
 * <p>In the above case, this also implies that a {@link PaymentTransaction} can have a <b>parent transaction</b> (retrieved
 * via {@link #getParentTransaction()}). The parent transaction will only be set in the following cases:</p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 *  <li>{@link PaymentTransactionType#CAPTURE} -> {@link PaymentTransactionType#AUTHORIZE}</li>
 *  <li>{@link PaymentTransactionType#REFUND} -> {@link PaymentTransactionType#CAPTURE} OR {@link PaymentTransactionType#SETTLED}</li>
 *  <li>{@link PaymentTransactionType#SETTLED} -> {@link PaymentTransactionType#CAPTURE}</li>
 *  <li>{@link PaymentTransactionType#VOID} -> {@link PaymentTransactionType#CAPTURE}</li>
 *  <li>{@link PaymentTransactionType#REVERSE_AUTH} -> {@link PaymentTransactionType#AUTHORIZE}</li>
 * </ul>
 *

# OrderPayment Interface

The OrderPayment interface represents a payment associated with an order. It includes methods for getting and setting properties such as the ID, the associated order, the billing address, the amount, the reference number, the type of payment, the payment gateway type, and the list of associated PaymentTransactions. It is closely related to the PaymentTransaction interface, as each OrderPayment can have multiple associated PaymentTransactions.

```java
/**
 * <p>This entity is designed to deal with payments associated to an {@link Order} and is <i>usually</i> unique for a particular
 * amount, {@link PaymentGatewayType} and {@link PaymentType} combination. This is immediately invalid for scenarios where multiple payments of the
 * same {@link PaymentType} should be supported (like paying with 2 {@link PaymentType#CREDIT_CARD} or 2 {@link PaymentType#GIFT_CARD}).
 * That said, even though the use case might be uncommon in, Broadleaf does not actively prevent that situation from occurring
 * online payments it is very common in point of sale systems.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Once an {@link OrderPayment} is created, various {@link PaymentTransaction}s can be applied to this payment as
 * denoted by {@link PaymentTransactionType}. <b>There should be at least 1 {@link PaymentTransaction} for every
 * {@link OrderPayment} that is associated with an {@link Order} that has gone through checkout</b> (which means that
 * {@link Order#getStatus()} is {@link OrderStatus#SUBMITTED}).</p>
 * 
 * <p>{@link OrderPayment}s are not actually deleted from the database but rather are only soft-deleted (archived = true)</p>
 * 
 * @see {@link PaymentTransactionType}
 * @see {@link PaymentTransaction}
 * @see {@link PaymentType}

# Applying Payment to Order

The applyPaymentToOrder method in the DefaultPaymentGatewayCheckoutService class demonstrates how to use the PaymentTransaction and OrderPayment interfaces. It creates a new OrderPayment, sets various properties on it, creates a new PaymentTransaction, associates it with the OrderPayment, and then saves the OrderPayment.

```java
    @Override
    public Long applyPaymentToOrder(PaymentResponseDTO responseDTO, PaymentGatewayConfiguration config) {
        
        //Payments can ONLY be parsed into Order Payments if they are 'valid'
        if (!responseDTO.isValid()) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid payment responses cannot be parsed into the order payment domain");
        }
        
        if (config == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Config service cannot be null");
        }
        
        Long orderId = Long.parseLong(responseDTO.getOrderId());
        Order order = orderService.findOrderById(orderId);
        
        if (!OrderStatus.IN_PROCESS.equals(order.getStatus()) && !OrderStatus.CSR_OWNED.equals(order.getStatus()) && !OrderStatus.QUOTE.equals(order.getStatus())) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Cannot apply another payment to an Order that is not IN_PROCESS or CSR_OWNED");
        }
        
        Customer customer = order.getCustomer();
        if (customer.isAnonymous()) {
```
