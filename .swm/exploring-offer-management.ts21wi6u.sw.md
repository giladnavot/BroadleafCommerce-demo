title: Exploring Offer Management
---
In the BroadleafCommerce-demo, an Offer is a crucial component of the e-commerce framework. It represents a promotional deal or discount that can be applied to items in a customer's shopping cart. The Offer is defined in the Offer interface and its implementation is provided in the OfferImpl class.

The Offer interface provides methods to determine if an offer is automatically added for consideration or if it can be combined with other offers. It also allows setting and getting the offer details.

The OfferService interface provides methods for managing offers, such as saving a new offer or updating an existing one, applying offers to an order, and building a list of offers that apply to a particular order.

The OfferTier interface represents a tier and amount combination for an offer. For example, an offer might allow a 10% off if a user purchases 1 -5 but then allow 15% off if they purchase more than 5.

The ItemOfferProcessor interface provides methods to review an item level offer against the list of discountable items from the order. If the offer applies, it is added to the qualifiedItemOffers list.

The AdvancedOfferPromotionMessageXref interface is used to associate an offer with a promotion message. It provides methods to get and set the offer and the promotion message.

    public void setId(Long id);

    public Long getId();

    public String getName();

    public void setName(String name);

    public String getDescription();

    public void setDescription(String description);
