title: Overview of Page Message
---
Page Message in BroadleafCommerce-demo refers to a mechanism for handling messages related to pages in the content management system. It is part of the Broadleaf Commerce Community Edition, an e-commerce framework. The 'Page Message' functionality is implemented in the 'org.broadleafcommerce.cms.page.message' package. It includes classes like 'ArchivedPagePublisher' and 'JMSArchivedPageSubscriber' that handle publishing and subscribing to page-related messages respectively. These messages are used to perform operations like invalidating cache keys for pages.

# ArchivedPagePublisher Interface

The `ArchivedPagePublisher` interface defines the contract for handling page archive events. The `processPageArchive` method is called when a page is archived.

```java
/**
 * The ArchivedPagePublisher will be notified when a page has
 * been marked as archived.    This provides a convenient cache-eviction
 * point for pages in production.
 *
 * Implementers of this service could send a JMS or AMQP message so
 * that other VMs can evict the item.
 *
 * Created by bpolster.
 */
public interface ArchivedPagePublisher {
    void processPageArchive(Page page, String basePageKey);
}
```

# JMSArchivedPagePublisher Implementation

public class JMSArchivedPagePublisher implements ArchivedPagePublisher {
```

# JMSArchivedPageSubscriber Class

The `JMSArchivedPageSubscriber` class listens for page archive messages. When a message is received, the `onMessage` method is called, which retrieves the page cache key from the message.

```java
    public void onMessage(Message message) {
        String basePageCacheKey = null;
        try {
            basePageCacheKey = ((TextMessage) message).getText();
        } catch (JMSException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }
```
