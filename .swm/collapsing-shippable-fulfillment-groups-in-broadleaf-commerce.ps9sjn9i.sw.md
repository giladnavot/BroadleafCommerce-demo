title: Collapsing Shippable Fulfillment Groups in Broadleaf Commerce
---
This document will cover the process of collapsing multiple shippable fulfillment groups into one, which includes:

1. Adding the entry to the cache
2. Putting the entry into the distributed queue
3. Writing the entry to the queue
4. Locking the queue for writing
5. Deleting the code type from the database
6. Checking if the entry is already in the queue.

# Adding the entry to the cache

The function `add` is used to add an entry to the cache. If the cache does not already contain the entry, it is added with the current timestamp.

```java
        public Long add(Long entry) {
            if (! cache.containsKey(entry)) {
                return cache.put(entry, new Long(System.currentTimeMillis()));
            }
            return null;
        }
```

# Putting the entry into the distributed queue

The function `put` is used to add the entry to the distributed queue. It creates a list of elements to add and calls `writeToQueue` to write the elements to the queue.

```java
    @Override
    public void put(T e) throws InterruptedException {
        final ArrayList<T> elementsToAdd = new ArrayList<>();
        elementsToAdd.add(e);
        writeToQueue(elementsToAdd, -1L);
    }
```

# Writing the entry to the queue

The function `writeToQueue` is used to write the entry to the queue. It locks the queue for writing, checks the remaining capacity of the queue, and writes the entry to the queue if there is enough capacity.

```java
    protected int writeToQueue(List<? extends T> entries, final long timeout) throws InterruptedException {
        if (entries == null || entries.isEmpty()) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int entryCount = 0;
        long waitTime = timeout;
        synchronized (QUEUE_MONITOR) {
            while (true) {
                boolean locked = false;
                DistributedLock lock = getQueueAccessLock();
                if (timeout < 0L) {
                    lock.lockInterruptibly();
                    locked = true;
                } else if (timeout > 0L && waitTime > 0L) {
                    long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
                    locked = lock.tryLock(waitTime, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
                    long end = System.currentTimeMillis();
                    waitTime -= (end - start);
                } else {
                    locked = lock.tryLock();
```

# Locking the queue for writing

The function `lockInterruptibly` is used to lock the queue for writing. It throws an exception if the thread was interrupted before trying to acquire the lock.

```java
    @Override
    public void lockInterruptibly() throws InterruptedException {
        if (Thread.interrupted()) {
            throw new InterruptedException("Thread was interrupted prior to trying to acquire the lock.");
        }
        
        lockInternally(-1L);
    }
```

# Deleting the code type from the database

The function `delete` is used to delete the code type from the database. It checks if the entity manager contains the code type, finds the code type if it does not, and removes the code type.

```java
    public void delete(CodeType codeType) {
        if (!em.contains(codeType)) {
            codeType = (CodeType) em.find(CodeTypeImpl.class, codeType.getId());
        }
        em.remove(codeType);
    }
```

# Checking if the entry is already in the queue

The function `contains` is used to check if the entry is already in the queue. It checks if the queue contains all elements in the given collection.

```java
    @Override
    public boolean contains(Object o) {
        return containsAll(Collections.singletonList(o));
    }
```
