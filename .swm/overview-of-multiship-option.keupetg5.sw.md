title: Overview of Multiship Option
---
The Multiship Option in BroadleafCommerce-demo refers to a feature that allows customers to send different items in their order to different shipping addresses. This is particularly useful in scenarios where a customer is shopping for gifts and wants to send them directly to the recipients. The `OrderMultishipOptionDao` interface and its implementation `OrderMultishipOptionDaoImpl` provide the necessary methods to manage these options, such as saving a new option, retrieving options associated with a specific order or order item, creating a new option instance, and deleting options.

# Creating a new Multiship Option

```java
    public OrderMultishipOption create();
```
