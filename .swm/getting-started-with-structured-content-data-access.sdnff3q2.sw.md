title: Getting Started with Structured Content Data Access
---
Structured Content Data Access in Broadleaf Commerce refers to the operations performed on the structured content data in the system. This includes querying, updating, adding, and deleting structured content items. The `StructuredContentDao` interface in the Broadleaf Commerce CMS module is responsible for these operations. It provides methods to find structured content by ID, find structured content types by ID or name, retrieve all structured content types, find all content items, add or update content items, and delete content items. The `StructuredContentDao` interface is implemented in `StructuredContentDaoImpl` class.

# StructuredContentDao Interface

The `StructuredContentDao` interface provides methods for querying and updating structured content items. It includes methods for finding content by ID or type, retrieving all content types, adding or updating content items, and deleting content items.

```java
public interface StructuredContentDao {

    /**
     * Returns the <code>StructuredContent</code> item that matches
     * the passed in Id.
     * @param contentId
     * @return the found item or null if it does not exist
     */
    public StructuredContent findStructuredContentById(Long contentId);

    /**
     * Returns the <code>StructuredContentType</code> that matches
     * the passed in contentTypeId.
     * @param contentTypeId
     * @return the found item or null if it does not exist
     */
    public StructuredContentType findStructuredContentTypeById(Long contentTypeId);

    /**
     * Returns the list of all <code>StructuredContentType</code>s.
     *
```
