title: Determining Offer Changes Process
---
This document will cover the process of determining offer changes in the Broadleaf Commerce framework. The process includes the following steps:

1. Executing the main function
2. Converting offers to IDs
3. Adding the IDs to the cache
4. Putting the IDs into the distributed queue
5. Writing the IDs to the queue
6. Locking the process
7. Deleting the code type
8. Checking if the ID is in the queue.

# Executing the main function

The `execute` function is the entry point of the process. It triggers the process of determining offer changes.

# Converting offers to IDs

The `convertOffersToIds` function is used to convert the set of offers into a set of IDs. These IDs are then used in the subsequent steps.

```java
    protected Set<Long> convertOffersToIds(Set<Offer> offers) {
        Set<Long> ids = new HashSet<>();
        for (Offer offer : offers) {
            ids.add(offer.getId());
        }
        return ids;
    }
```

# Adding the IDs to the cache

The `add` function is used to add the IDs to the cache. If the ID is not already in the cache, it is added along with the current timestamp.

```java
        public Long add(Long entry) {
            if (! cache.containsKey(entry)) {
                return cache.put(entry, new Long(System.currentTimeMillis()));
            }
            return null;
        }
```

# Putting the IDs into the distributed queue

The `put` function is used to put the IDs into the distributed queue. It calls the `writeToQueue` function to actually write the IDs to the queue.

```java
    @Override
    public void put(T e) throws InterruptedException {
        final ArrayList<T> elementsToAdd = new ArrayList<>();
        elementsToAdd.add(e);
        writeToQueue(elementsToAdd, -1L);
    }
```

# Writing the IDs to the queue

The `writeToQueue` function is used to write the IDs to the queue. It uses a lock to ensure that the process is thread-safe.

```java
    protected int writeToQueue(List<? extends T> entries, final long timeout) throws InterruptedException {
        if (entries == null || entries.isEmpty()) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int entryCount = 0;
        long waitTime = timeout;
        synchronized (QUEUE_MONITOR) {
            while (true) {
                boolean locked = false;
                DistributedLock lock = getQueueAccessLock();
                if (timeout < 0L) {
                    lock.lockInterruptibly();
                    locked = true;
                } else if (timeout > 0L && waitTime > 0L) {
                    long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
                    locked = lock.tryLock(waitTime, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
                    long end = System.currentTimeMillis();
                    waitTime -= (end - start);
                } else {
                    locked = lock.tryLock();
```

# Locking the process

The `lockInterruptibly` function is used to lock the process. It ensures that the process is not interrupted while it is being executed.

```java
    @Override
    public void lockInterruptibly() throws InterruptedException {
        if (Thread.interrupted()) {
            throw new InterruptedException("Thread was interrupted prior to trying to acquire the lock.");
        }
        
        lockInternally(-1L);
    }
```

# Deleting the code type

The `delete` function is used to delete the code type. It ensures that the code type is removed from the database.

```java
    public void delete(CodeType codeType) {
        if (!em.contains(codeType)) {
            codeType = (CodeType) em.find(CodeTypeImpl.class, codeType.getId());
        }
        em.remove(codeType);
    }
```

# Checking if the ID is in the queue

The `contains` function is used to check if the ID is in the queue. It returns true if the ID is in the queue and false otherwise.

```java
    @Override
    public boolean contains(Object o) {
        return containsAll(Collections.singletonList(o));
    }
```
