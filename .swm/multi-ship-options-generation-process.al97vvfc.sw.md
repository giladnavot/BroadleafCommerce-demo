title: Multi-ship Options Generation Process
---
This document will cover the process of generating and managing multi-ship options for orders in the BroadleafCommerce-demo project. The process includes:

1. Initiating the generation of multi-ship options
2. Creating populated multi-ship options
3. Adding the options to a distributed queue
4. Writing the options to the queue.

# Initiating the generation of multi-ship options

The function `getOrGenerateOrderMultishipOptions` initiates the process. It checks if multi-ship options for the order already exist. If not, it calls `generateOrderMultishipOptions` to create them.

# Creating populated multi-ship options

`generateOrderMultishipOptions` creates the multi-ship options for the order. It does this by calling `createPopulatedOrderMultishipOption` for each item in the order.

# Adding the options to a distributed queue

`createPopulatedOrderMultishipOption` adds each created multi-ship option to a distributed queue using the `add` method.

```java
        public Long add(Long entry) {
            if (! cache.containsKey(entry)) {
                return cache.put(entry, new Long(System.currentTimeMillis()));
            }
            return null;
        }
```

# Writing the options to the queue

The `writeToQueue` method is used to write the multi-ship options to the distributed queue. It uses a lock to ensure thread safety during the write operation.

```java
    protected int writeToQueue(List<? extends T> entries, final long timeout) throws InterruptedException {
        if (entries == null || entries.isEmpty()) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int entryCount = 0;
        long waitTime = timeout;
        synchronized (QUEUE_MONITOR) {
            while (true) {
                boolean locked = false;
                DistributedLock lock = getQueueAccessLock();
                if (timeout < 0L) {
                    lock.lockInterruptibly();
                    locked = true;
                } else if (timeout > 0L && waitTime > 0L) {
                    long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
                    locked = lock.tryLock(waitTime, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
                    long end = System.currentTimeMillis();
                    waitTime -= (end - start);
                } else {
                    locked = lock.tryLock();
```
