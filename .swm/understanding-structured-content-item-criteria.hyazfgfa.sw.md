title: Understanding Structured Content Item Criteria
---
Structured Content Item Criteria in Broadleaf Commerce refers to the rules that determine the display of structured content items. These rules are used for targeting specific structured content items to users based on certain conditions. For instance, a structured content item could be set up to only show to users who have a particular product in their cart. The StructuredContentItemCriteria interface provides methods to get and set the parent structured content item, and to clone the item criteria. This functionality is crucial in the content management system when an item is edited.

# StructuredContentItemCriteria Interface

This is the StructuredContentItemCriteria interface. It extends QuantityBasedRule and MultiTenantCloneable. It provides methods to get and set the parent StructuredContent item, and to clone the entity.

```java
public interface StructuredContentItemCriteria extends QuantityBasedRule,MultiTenantCloneable<StructuredContentItemCriteria> {

    /**
     * Returns the parent <code>StructuredContent</code> item to which this
     * field belongs.
     *
     * @return
     */
    @Nonnull
    public StructuredContent getStructuredContent();

    /**
     * Sets the parent <code>StructuredContent</code> item.
     * @param structuredContent
     */
    public void setStructuredContent(@Nonnull StructuredContent structuredContent);

    /**
     * Builds a copy of this item.   Used by the content management system when an
     * item is edited.
     *
```
