title: Overview of Web in BroadleafCommerce-demo
---
In BroadleafCommerce-demo, 'Web' refers to the web layer of the application, specifically the admin module. This layer is responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses, and it interacts with the underlying service and data layers. It is implemented using Spring MVC, a component of the Spring Framework that provides a model-view-controller architecture for building web applications.

## AdminInventoryBasicOperationsController

The `AdminInventoryBasicOperationsController` class defines endpoints for basic inventory operations. It includes a `showSelectCollectionItem` method which is mapped to the `/com.broadleafcommerce.inventory.advanced.domain.InventoryImpl/{collectionField:.*}/select` URL and handles GET requests. This method is used to show a selected collection item in the inventory.

```java
@Controller("blAdminInventoryBasicOperationsController")
@RequestMapping("/com.broadleafcommerce.inventory.advanced.domain.InventoryImpl")
public class AdminInventoryBasicOperationsController extends AdminBasicOperationsController {


    @Resource(name = "blCatalogService")
    protected CatalogService catalogService;

    @RequestMapping(value = "/{collectionField:.*}/select", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public String showSelectCollectionItem(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Model model,
                                           @PathVariable Map<String, String> pathVars,
                                           @PathVariable String collectionField, @RequestParam(required = false) String requestingEntityId,
                                           @RequestParam(required = false) boolean dynamicField,
                                           @RequestParam MultiValueMap<String, String> requestParams) throws Exception {
        String view = super.showSelectCollectionItem(request, response, model, pathVars, "com.broadleafcommerce.inventory.advanced.domain.InventoryImpl", collectionField, requestingEntityId, dynamicField, requestParams);
        String queryString = requestParams.entrySet().stream().flatMap(
                k -> k.getValue().stream().map(v -> new AbstractMap.SimpleEntry<String, String>(k.getKey(), v))
        ).map(e -> e.getKey() + '=' + e.getValue()).collect(Collectors.joining("&"));
        if (!queryString.contains("fulfillmentType=") && StringUtils.isNotEmpty(request.getParameter("inventoryParameter"))) {
            List<SectionCrumb> sectionCrumbs = this.getSectionCrumbs(request, (String) null, (String) null);
            if (CollectionUtils.isNotEmpty(sectionCrumbs) && sectionCrumbs.get(0).getSectionIdentifier().equals("inventory")) {
```

## AdminCatalogActionsController

The `AdminCatalogActionsController` class defines endpoints for catalog actions. It includes a `generateSkus` method which is mapped to the `product/{productId}/{skusFieldName}/generate-skus` URL and handles GET requests. This method is used to generate a list of Skus for a particular product and its product options.

```java
@Controller("blAdminCatalogActionsController")
public class AdminCatalogActionsController extends AdminAbstractController {

    @Resource(name = "blAdminCatalogService")
    protected AdminCatalogService adminCatalogService;
    @Autowired
    protected MessageSource messageSource;

    /**
     * Invokes a separate service to generate a list of Skus for a particular {@link Product} and that {@link Product}'s
     * Product Options
     */
    @RequestMapping(value = "product/{productId}/{skusFieldName}/generate-skus",
            method = RequestMethod.GET,
            produces = "application/json")
    public @ResponseBody Map<String, Object> generateSkus(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Model model,
                                                          @PathVariable(value = "productId") Long productId,
                                                          @PathVariable(value = "skusFieldName") String skusFieldName) {
        Map<String, Object> responseBody = adminCatalogService.generateSkus(productId);

        String url = request.getRequestURL().toString();
```
