title: Discount Application and Queue Management Flow
---
This document will cover the process of applying discounts to order items and managing them in a distributed queue in the BroadleafCommerce-demo project. The process includes:

1. Copying finalized data
2. Adding candidate item price detail adjustment
3. Adding to resource purge service
4. Putting and adding to Zookeeper distributed queue
5. Writing to queue and managing locks
6. Deleting code type from DAO

# Copying finalized data

The `copyWithFinalizedData` function is the starting point of this flow. It is responsible for creating a copy of the current `PromotableOrderItemPriceDetailImpl` object with finalized data.

# Adding candidate item price detail adjustment

The `addCandidateItemPriceDetailAdjustment` function is called next. It adds a `PromotableOrderItemPriceDetailAdjustment` to the list of adjustments for the current `PromotableOrderItemPriceDetailImpl` object.

```java
    @Override
    public void addCandidateItemPriceDetailAdjustment(PromotableOrderItemPriceDetailAdjustment itemAdjustment) {
        promotableOrderItemPriceDetailAdjustments.add(itemAdjustment);
    }
```

# Adding to resource purge service

The `add` function in `ResourcePurgeServiceImpl` is then called. It adds an entry to the cache if it doesn't already exist.

```java
        public Long add(Long entry) {
            if (! cache.containsKey(entry)) {
                return cache.put(entry, new Long(System.currentTimeMillis()));
            }
            return null;
        }
```

# Putting and adding to Zookeeper distributed queue

The `put` function in `ZookeeperDistributedQueue` is called next. It adds an element to the queue.

```java
    @Override
    public void put(T e) throws InterruptedException {
        final ArrayList<T> elementsToAdd = new ArrayList<>();
        elementsToAdd.add(e);
        writeToQueue(elementsToAdd, -1L);
    }
```

The `add` function in `ZookeeperDistributedQueue` is also called. It adds an element to the queue and throws an exception if the queue is full.

```java
    @Override
    public boolean add(T e) {
        try {
            final ArrayList<T> lst = new ArrayList<>();
            lst.add(e);
            int count = writeToQueue(lst, 0L);
            if (count != 1) {
                throw new IllegalStateException("The Zookeeper queue was full.");
            } else {
                return true;
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException ex) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            return false;
        }
    }
```

# Writing to queue and managing locks

The `writeToQueue` function in `ZookeeperDistributedQueue` is called. It writes entries to the queue while managing locks to ensure thread safety.

```java
    protected int writeToQueue(List<? extends T> entries, final long timeout) throws InterruptedException {
        if (entries == null || entries.isEmpty()) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int entryCount = 0;
        long waitTime = timeout;
        synchronized (QUEUE_MONITOR) {
            while (true) {
                boolean locked = false;
                DistributedLock lock = getQueueAccessLock();
                if (timeout < 0L) {
                    lock.lockInterruptibly();
                    locked = true;
                } else if (timeout > 0L && waitTime > 0L) {
                    long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
                    locked = lock.tryLock(waitTime, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
                    long end = System.currentTimeMillis();
                    waitTime -= (end - start);
                } else {
                    locked = lock.tryLock();
```

# Deleting code type from DAO

Finally, the `delete` function in `CodeTypeDaoImpl` is called. It removes a `CodeType` object from the database.

```java
    public void delete(CodeType codeType) {
        if (!em.contains(codeType)) {
            codeType = (CodeType) em.find(CodeTypeImpl.class, codeType.getId());
        }
        em.remove(codeType);
    }
```
