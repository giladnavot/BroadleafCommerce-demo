title: Overview of Tax Type
---
TaxType in BroadleafCommerce-demo refers to the different types of taxes that can be applied in the e-commerce context. It is an extensible enumeration of tax detail types, which includes CITY, STATE, DISTRICT, COUNTY, COUNTRY, SHIPPING, and COMBINED. Each of these types represents a specific tax that can be applied to an order. For example, CITY represents city tax, STATE represents state tax, and so on. The COMBINED type is used to represent total taxes owed.

# TaxType Constants

These are the static constants provided by the TaxType class. Each constant represents a specific type of tax. For example, CITY represents city tax, STATE represents state tax, and so on.

```java
    public static final TaxType CITY = new TaxType("CITY", "City");
    public static final TaxType STATE = new TaxType("STATE", "State");
    public static final TaxType DISTRICT = new TaxType("DISTRICT", "District");
    public static final TaxType COUNTY = new TaxType("COUNTY", "County");
    public static final TaxType COUNTRY = new TaxType("COUNTRY", "Country");
    public static final TaxType SHIPPING = new TaxType("SHIPPING", "Shipping");

    // Used by SimpleTaxProvider to represent total taxes owed.
    public static final TaxType COMBINED = new TaxType("COMBINED", "Combined");
```

        this.friendlyType = friendlyType;
        setType(type);
    }
```
