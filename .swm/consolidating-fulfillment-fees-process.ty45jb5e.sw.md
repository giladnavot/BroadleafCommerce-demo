title: Consolidating Fulfillment Fees Process
---
This document will cover the process of consolidating fulfillment fees in the BroadleafCommerce-demo project. The process includes the following steps:

1. Executing the main function
2. Checking if the fee should be applied to the fulfillment group
3. Adding the fee to the fulfillment group
4. Writing the fee to the queue
5. Locking the process
6. Deleting the code type
7. Checking if the queue contains the fee
8. Adding the fee to the resource purge service.

# Executing the main function

The `execute` function in `ConsolidateFulfillmentFeesActivity.java` is the starting point of the process. It's responsible for initiating the process of consolidating fulfillment fees.

# Checking if the fee should be applied to the fulfillment group

`shouldApplyFeeToFulfillmentGroup` function checks if the fee should be applied to the fulfillment group. This is a crucial step to ensure that the fee is only applied when necessary.

```java
    /**
     * If the SkuFee expression is null or empty, this method will always return true
     * 
     * @param fee
     * @param fulfillmentGroup
     * @return
     */
    protected boolean shouldApplyFeeToFulfillmentGroup(SkuFee fee, FulfillmentGroup fulfillmentGroup) {
        boolean appliesToFulfillmentGroup = true;
        String feeExpression = fee.getExpression();
        
        if (StringUtils.isNotEmpty(feeExpression)) {
            synchronized (EXPRESSION_CACHE) {
                HashMap<String, Object> vars = new HashMap<>();
                vars.put("fulfillmentGroup", fulfillmentGroup);
                MvelHelper.evaluateRule(feeExpression, vars, EXPRESSION_CACHE);
            }
        }
        
        return appliesToFulfillmentGroup;
    }
```

# Adding the fee to the fulfillment group

The `addFulfillmentGroupFee` function in `FulfillmentGroupImpl.java` is responsible for adding the fee to the fulfillment group. It checks if the `fulfillmentGroupFees` list is null, and if so, it initializes it. Then it adds the `fulfillmentGroupFee` to the list.

```java
    @Override
    public void addFulfillmentGroupFee(FulfillmentGroupFee fulfillmentGroupFee) {
        if (fulfillmentGroupFees == null) {
            fulfillmentGroupFees = new ArrayList<FulfillmentGroupFee>();
        }
        fulfillmentGroupFees.add(fulfillmentGroupFee);
    }
```

# Writing the fee to the queue

The `writeToQueue` function in `ZookeeperDistributedQueue.java` is responsible for writing the fee to the queue. It ensures that the entries are not null or empty, and then it writes each entry to the queue.

```java
    protected int writeToQueue(List<? extends T> entries, final long timeout) throws InterruptedException {
        if (entries == null || entries.isEmpty()) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int entryCount = 0;
        long waitTime = timeout;
        synchronized (QUEUE_MONITOR) {
            while (true) {
                boolean locked = false;
                DistributedLock lock = getQueueAccessLock();
                if (timeout < 0L) {
                    lock.lockInterruptibly();
                    locked = true;
                } else if (timeout > 0L && waitTime > 0L) {
                    long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
                    locked = lock.tryLock(waitTime, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
                    long end = System.currentTimeMillis();
                    waitTime -= (end - start);
                } else {
                    locked = lock.tryLock();
```

# Locking the process

The `lockInterruptibly` function in `ReentrantDistributedZookeeperLock.java` is responsible for locking the process. This is to ensure that the process is not interrupted while it's being executed.

```java
    @Override
    public void lockInterruptibly() throws InterruptedException {
        if (Thread.interrupted()) {
            throw new InterruptedException("Thread was interrupted prior to trying to acquire the lock.");
        }
        
        lockInternally(-1L);
    }
```

# Deleting the code type

The `delete` function in `CodeTypeDaoImpl.java` is responsible for deleting the code type. This is to ensure that the code type is removed from the system once it's no longer needed.

```java
    public void delete(CodeType codeType) {
        if (!em.contains(codeType)) {
            codeType = (CodeType) em.find(CodeTypeImpl.class, codeType.getId());
        }
        em.remove(codeType);
    }
```

# Checking if the queue contains the fee

The `contains` function in `ZookeeperDistributedQueue.java` is responsible for checking if the queue contains the fee. This is to ensure that the fee has been successfully written to the queue.

```java
    @Override
    public boolean contains(Object o) {
        return containsAll(Collections.singletonList(o));
    }
```

# Adding the fee to the resource purge service

The `add` function in `ResourcePurgeServiceImpl.java` is responsible for adding the fee to the resource purge service. This is to ensure that the fee is removed from the system once it's no longer needed.

```java
        public Long add(Long entry) {
            if (! cache.containsKey(entry)) {
                return cache.put(entry, new Long(System.currentTimeMillis()));
            }
            return null;
        }
```
